**What if the user is a group?**
  - We have to recommend for a group of people → one recommendation
  - Movie, tv program, restaurant, experience, house, TV, holiday to a
    GROUP


## Main steps for group recommendations
1.  Obtain individual preferences – need a user profile/ model for each
    individual user
    - Content based – need to look at the parameters and put this
        within the user model
    - Social (collaborative) – we look for user’s interest and
        opinions about particular items
2.  **Aggregation strategies** – to aggregate and come up with one recommendation →
    focus of the lec
3.  Present the recommendations to the group with appropriate
    justification


**Example**
  - We have 4 users and 10 items
  - For each of the user, we have preferences for each item – 1 to 20

  - Q - How would you select the best item?
      - A – with the highest score amongst many users


### Aggregation strategies: Average
  - **Take the average for each item and take the item with the highest average**
  - If we want to recommend more than one, we take it in order
  - 10 /20 is a nice compromise for the group
  - Disadvantage – the users will be disadvantaged bc strong values tend
    to diminish the bad choices – like 15 and 20

### Aggregation strategies: Multiplicative
  - **Multiple individual scores**
  - Multiply all the user rating and select the highest

### Aggregation strategies: Approval voting
  - **Counts scores above a certain threshold, seen as approval value**
  - Threshold value above \> and we count how many
  - So for item 1=1, item 2 = 0, item3 = 3


### Aggregation strategies: Plurality voting
  - **Choose the item with highest number of votes. → per user\!\!**
    - e.g. So u1 and u4 voted item 9 -> got 2 votes, hence chosen
  - Skewed - few users and few items. And also low scores are observed
    by the strong ones
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99927971-95fc2a80-2d8a-11eb-8a98-7afbb01c0880.png) → item 9 \!\!

### Aggregation strategies: Least Misery
  - **Considers the minimum scores for each item, and chooses the item with the maximum (minimum-scored) value (least miserable)**
  - LM looks at the lowest item, and out of those chooses the least miserable
  - User will fall into disadvantage bc its with majority
  - !![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99927991-a7ddcd80-2d8a-11eb-9533-50307e64b51a.png) → 5 is the best choice
    - User 1 is the most unhappy, but won't be toooo bad
  - Can be combined with other strategies e.g. average – its easy but it
    can disadvantage people. However, if we do average without misery,
    then we take everything below 4, and item 5 will have stronger
    confidence now


### Aggregation strategies: Most pleasure
  - **Considers the maximum of the scores for each item, and chooses the item with the maximum value – most pleasure**
  - So item 4 (rating = 20)


### Aggregation strategies: Borda
  - To ignore actual values and start looking at the ranking
  - **Considers item ranking in the individual preferences, then calculates the item ranking for the group**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928006-b4622600-2d8a-11eb-942d-d67075d10ab3.png)
  - We rank the item in order and give the value starting from
    1-10. Highest gets 10 and lowest gets 1
  - Then we add all the items and see what the highest is


### Aggregation strategies: Copeland Rule
  - **Counts how often an item beats another item (majority voting) and how many time loses – takes the difference as the value**
  - → We compare the item1 to every other items in both sides of the column
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928025-c6dc5f80-2d8a-11eb-8187-163e19ab2e57.png)
    - e.g. Item 2 – 5,3,6,5. And we compare this to item 1 (1,3,4,9) & item 3 (3,7,15,8)
    - 5 beats 1, 6 beats 4, 5 beats 3 -> so it in total, beat = 3
  - beats – loses =  copeland. Then choose item with highest copeland value.


### Aggregation strategies: Heuristics
  - So far, item 5 seems the strongest as it was recommended by most of the aggregation strategies
    - It won't make people too miserable, and it gives everybody a reasonable choice assuming that user 3 isn't the dominant user (**authority)**
  - **Fairness**: take the best option for everyone
  - **Authority**: take the best option for the most influential user



## How do we know which is the best option - Evaluation
  - You recommend and see how individual members of the group feels
    about it.
  - Reading – when people was given the recommendation for the group and asked how satisfied they were, and what their friends thought
  - Two keys factor of people’s satisfaction with the group recommendations
      - **Affective state –** am I happy or grumpy – people take the
        recommendation based on their mood and like/ dislike
      - **Relationships with other users -**


**Impact of relationships on accepting group recommendations**
  - Several relationships that it might affect
  - You are not 100% satisfied, but okay with the rec
      - **Communal sharing** -Best friend – if you have to compromise
        for someone you like, you’d be happy
      - **Authority ranking -** High respect – if the recommendation was chosen by the most influential user and that person has priority, they take it even though its not their choice
  - Unhappy and more sensitive about not being taken into account
      - **Market pricing -** Someone you compete with – will be fighting
        for fairness
      - **Equality matching** - If you think the rec was unequal
  - → When you explain the final choice, need to bear in mind the relationship
    between people


## Summary
  - Obtain individual preferences
  - **Aggregation strategies → key \!\!**
      - Most system use **hybridisation** of these strategies
      - Evaluation is **important** and need to tune the strategies or
        heuristics → will be able to explain better
      - Opinions will be influenced by **affect** and **relationships**
  - Presenting the recommendations to the group
