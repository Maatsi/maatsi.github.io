**Metrics, engagement and personalisation**
  - Talk from Mounia Lalmas – spotify’s Head of personalisation


### 1. User engagement

**User engagement:** The quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of interaction |
  - How to measure the positive experience
  - In particular, the fact of **wanting** to stay on the side of the
    technology for **longer** and **often**; hence leading to loyal
    users

**Why is user engagement important?**
  - \+ Can make the user become loyal
  - \+ You can collect more data about the user and can improve on the
    service
  - \+ User paying for more services
  - \+ User advertising to other people if they have a positive
    experience
  - question to ask is why am I doing?

**Mounia’s answer; Why is user engagement important?**
  - Users have increasingly enhanced expectations about their
    interactions with technology
      - This leads to increase competition amongst the providers with
        other services
  - Utilitarian factors such as usability experiential factors of
    interactions (e.g. fun, fulfilment) user engagement

**User engagement lifecycle**

  - **New** users
  - **Active** users
      - There's a period where the users are **active** – they can stay
        engaged or can be **disengaged**. Some of them can be
        **re-engaged**
      - With user’s behaviour, you can estimate if the person is likely
        to be engaged/ disengaged based on their interaction
  - **Dormant** user – can be re-engaged or churn
  - We need to understand the rectangle\!\! Of the active user in order
    to keep users engaged


### 2. Metrics

  - measurement and KPI lies \!\! parallel \!\!


**We need several metrics -** from what we measure to something meaningful/
clever
  - Games – users spend a long time per visit
  - SNS – users come frequently and stay long
  - Search – frequent and short
  - Niche – once a week
  - News – come periodically



### 3. Interpretations

**1. Abandonment in search –** when there is no click on the search
result page
  - Satisfied – user clicks and abandon; good abandonment
  - Dissatisfied – didn’t get what they want; bad abandonment

  - **Measuring abandonment**
      - **Cursor trail length** – total distance travelled by cursor on
        search result page
          - Short for good abandonment
      - **Movement time** – total time cursor moved on the search result
        page
          - Longer when answers in snippet
      - **Cursor speed –** average cursor speed
          - Slower when answer is in snippet – good abandonment
  - Total time spent on search result page


**2. Dwell time in search**
  - Better proxy for **user interest** on a news article than click
  - E.g. open a link and how long do you spend to look at the link; not
    moving the cursor but staying in the link
      - Indicat
      es that user is engaged

**3. Dwell time in search: Eye tracking**

  - Since dwell time is so important they are combining w Eye tracking
      - Can determine bad or good abandonment
  - With the tracking can determine if the user is
    reading the article or if they got lost

  - **Relevant document vs irrelevant document**
      - Left - Engaged w particular document – positive abandonment
      - Right – lost – negative engagement
      - areas and duration of fixation


  - The **trajectory** **of the eye**
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708183-8f13cf80-0c96-11eb-9a6c-f9beb5e8caff.png)
      - Allow us to know the sequence of the area user is focused on
      - Left – how much time user has spent in each area (e.g. menu,
        content etc)
      - Right – more engaged coz its more strategic
  - **WHERE they looked at + for HOW LONG + TRAJECTORY engagement of the
    user**


**Summary**
  - User engagement is applied to:
      - Advertisements
      - Office environment to monitor workers
  - Main points
      - User engagement has a lifecycle
          - By separating the lifecycle, the team knows where to improve
            and what to focus on and divide up the work
      - Metrics depend on the context – in terms of what you want to
        personalise
  - Detecting and understanding implicit signals of user satisfaction
    are essential for enhancing the quality of recommendations


**Applying to YouTube**
  - What to measure
      - Click time
      - Watch time
      - What is shown to the user and what the user clicks
      - Likes, watch history
      - \*Metadata about the videos
          - Topic, authors, likes
  - Performance indicators
      - Engagement (watch at least one video)
      - Click on at least one advertisement from video
      - Type of content user is interested in
  - Metrics
      - Attention – whenabouts people leave the vid
      - Click through rate
      - If they can predict how long people stay in the vid
