### 1. What is a Binary Tree?
- A tree whose elements have at most 2 child nodes - the left and the right node.
- Nodes with no children are called 'leaves'.  
- The height h of a complete binary tree with N nodes is at most **O(log N)**.
  > - n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2<sup>h-1</sup> + 2<sup>h</sup> = 2<sup>h+1</sup> - 1
  > - Solving for h gives **O(log n)**


| Complete tree | Full Tree |
|-------------- | --------- |
| A tree that is completely filled, except for the bottom level, which is filled from left to right. | Binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children |

#### Binary Search Tree
- Each node contains **one** key (also known as data)
- The keys in the **left subtree are less then the key in its parent node**, in short L < P;
  - 10 > 6, 4, 8
- The keys in the **right subtree are greater the key in its parent node**, in short P < R;
  - 10 < 18, 15, 21

#### Steps and Pseudocode
1. Example
| Input | Output | Result |  
| ----- | ------ | ------ |

2. Tree traversal
- traverse the tree from the root, to the left and right sub Tree
#### Pseudo


3. Check set bits
  - Check if the last bit is odd.
    - if odd then ans+1
  - Shift the bits to the right
  - Shift until the end of the bits

#### Pseudocode
```
check_set_bits():
  for (0 to len(bits)) {
    if (last bit is odd) {
      ans +=1
    }
    bit >> 1
  }
```
