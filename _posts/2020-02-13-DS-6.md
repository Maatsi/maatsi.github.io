**Goal** – to understand principles behind web services and their use  
  - Service is usually managed by a service provider; think of it as
    an application. If you need to access the service, you need an
    interface to invoke the interface.
  - We gonna look at how to implement service-oriented architecture.


**Distributed Computing Paradigms & Web services**

  - Paradigms that have made distributed computing over the years
  - **First** - Goes back many years ago when internet was invented- the
    idea was to link all the <span class="underline">machines</span>
    together. I need sth that make them talk to each other
      - Internet, TCP IP protocol stack
      - 2 - 15 - 100 - now more than a billion machines connected to the
        internet


  - **Second**- With the advent of the web, if you have all sorts of
    <span class="underline">document</span>, we need some form of
    infrastructure which allows us to access all sorts. And therefore,
    to make it happen, we need a protocol
      - hence HTTP, XMP, Json


  - **Third -** If we move to the next step and we talk about
    <span class="underline">application</span> that u’d like to share
    it with others. If we link all the apps together, we end up with
    Service Oriented Architectures
      - Web services are there to implement the concept of SOA
          - SOAP, WSDL, UDDI
          - REST



**Why use XML for structuring and exchanging data?**
  - Easily extended, Data is self-described
  - Text based -easy to parse, portable and human friendly
  - And it doesn’t belong to anybody\! – non-proprietary
  - Easy to represent the data, esp when exchanging data btwn client and
    server


**Why use JSON for structuring and exchanging data?**
  - Lightweight, text data interchange format
  - Language independent and human friendly
  - Self-describing and easy to understand
  - Diff btwn json notation and xml – but easy to use existing parser to
    parse XML or JSON
  - When you invoke a web service, you usually have the choice to tell
    the service provider to send back the reply in json or xml


## Service Oriented Architecture
  - Web services are there to support the development of SOA
  - Self-contained, self-describing modular unit participating in a
    larger ecosystem
      - Insist on the word ecosystem – all the services being loosely
        coupled live in harmony\!
  - SOA recap
      - Service **provider** - owns the service it needs to describe and
        publish it via **broker**
      - Client or **requester** – uses broker to **find**, then **bind
        to** a service
      - **Broker**- acting as a “yellow book” directory for services          - Broker is here to play the role of the middleman
          - new word in this ecosystem called the broker, some form of
            directory for services, search and use it
  - IMPORTANCE of the internal middleware in btwn client and service
    side.

**Example: Book a flight and car**

  - When you book a flight you do it via a website. → broker
  - Broker tells us all the available flights that are advertised.
  - If we book a flight w/ Ryanair, runs a website in online booking
    system, it will ask me if I wanna book a car to Hertz – this partner
    basically runs a booking system. It provides an interface to a web
    service. And ryan air becomes a client of the web service.
  - They have diff hw and sw but they can be loosely coupled with a WS –
    both business can benefit from it.
  - SOA would allow you to dynamically discover services via brokerage.
    But its likely that they have partnership, therefore it’s important
    to provide interface to the company on the RHS


## What are Web Services?
  - **Web service** is a piece of business logic, located on the
    internet and can be accessed using standard XML or **standard
    protocols** such as HTTP or STMP
  - Doesn’t necessarily replace existing DS, but is a coarse grain to
    exposing and advertising enterprise services
  - Fundamental idea of SOA is that as a service provider, you publish
    and expose your service.
      - Can be published on platforms – google, amazon etc
  - If you are able to access the web services, then you have opportunity to build large
    scale, loosely coupled DS without any constraining technology. If
    google amazon can expose these technologies, interoperability isn’t
    a problem anymore
      - Loosely coupled - There’s no real dependency between the
        programs
      - You will simply invoke the services to develop system components

<!-- end list -->

1.  Described using a service description language,
      - Service should be described to interface and you still need to
        describe so that they know the request that can be made
        algorithms that are used
          - E.g. if I’m a service provider and I have a method ‘do it’ =
            this method has a name, and it needs two arguments\!
            arguments are item name and quantity → your describing the
            service. The end user looks at this description and stick to
            it – its part of the contract/ policy.
          - Important for The SERVER to tell me what transport its
            expecting


2.  Published to a registry of services
      - WS needs to tell registry service where the service is located -
        Its published to a yellow page, and can be discovered by
        clients, and standard mechanism to access the service you need.


3.  Discovered through a standard mechanism (at runtime or design time)
      - Client can find the service through search and access. It with
        standard mechanism


4.  Invoked through a declared API, usually over a network,
      - If the service said that there is a method called do it, and 2
        arguments. And as a client if I want to invoke it, ill need to
        stick to that.
      - In the end of the day ill always expect some sort of reply from
        the service itself.


5.  Composed with other services.
      - To compose your service with other services and have a
        <span class="underline">chain</span> of web services.
      - Here I invoke service 1, get some output – this can become an
        input to web service no 2. and this output can be fed to 3 and
        get a final result.
      - What does this mean? Need to build an app that can integrate the
        WS – every time you invoke a service you feed input and extract
        some useful output
      - E.g. When your going to a football match – weather, city, how to
        get → all these are composition of WS


## What are Web Services Protocols?

  - They’ve implemented this through number of protocols to make this
    service description, discovery and invocation
  - The way it works is you have 3 main components of web services
      - **WSDL** – used to describe a service
      - **UDDI** – as a broker to discover service
      - **SOAP** – achieve platform and implementation independent, and
        can compose a chain of WS
  - You need protocols to make this vision happen
  - SOAP – simple object access protocol – over time it became service
    oriented architecture protocol

## The Big picture
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74752602-d7ddca80-5266-11ea-8c79-b27d4e099bef.png)

1. You are here, you are a soap client and you are building an app that invokes an amazon service.  

2. Send a request to amazon server, it understands that your talking SOAP, and invokes SOAP processor, and soap processor understands the business logic, it gets the logic and execute it  

3. Sends back a response  
    - Before doing this, client needs the description of the service –
      gets it from UDDI registry or directly from service provider - is
      described through WSDL
    - EMPHAIZE the importance of having WSDL – which describes the interface
      of services


## SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
  - It ain't simple.
  - Sometimes name gets given to protocols without understanding what
    they do – it’s a mechanism to ensure that the client and server can
    communicate through some sort of messaging
  - What it does
      - Takes the packaging of information sent btwn the client and
        server, in a standard way. To do that, over HTTP, SMTP etc
          - First look at the standard, build a msg, send the msg, get
            the reply
      - Supports synchronous (RPC) and asynchronous (document tranfer)
        modes of communication
          - AGAIN, RPC style – still using remote procedure call, where
            client sends the rq, client invokes a method which is part
            of the service. request reply, invokes a method. very imp
              - You can decide if you want it sync or async.
      - It provides interoperability abstraction of conventional RPC/
        RMI
          - RPC – invoke remote procedure call
          - RMI – where you invoke a remote object in the server, that
            is the same principle



**How XML becomes SOAP**

  - Client builds a soap msg → Sent through network through a soap
    server
  - The soap is very much how you wrap your msg – with a lot of XML → SOAP
    body
  - Once you have a body (I want to invoke this, these are the params,
    this is the transport), ull have to put it in a SOAP envelope.
  - However, you may want to look at extra information that will help
    how soap server process your message – SOAP header is added to help
    SOAP processor do sth with your request
  - However, it has to go through a network, and server and client have
    diff OS, diff platform and data encoding –have to look at naming and
    namespace declaration and you need to agree in encoding style and
    directives
      - This is where NAMING becomes important

**Overall Structure**

  - Body – it looks like im invoking a web service in that link, and its
    invoking through a host name which is just a ‘string’. Already some
    basic info of what im invoking
  - Envelope – XML namespace
      - xsd – naming service in XML **schema**
      - Xsi - refers to an **instance** of the xsi.
      - Difference
          - Xsd describes the ns – looking at the elements, attributes
            and types – anything server and client needs to agree when
            they exchange data
          - Xsi refers to an instance. Could think about specific types
            as an int, float, but more importantly, here for
            **instance** you have **directives** for XML schema
            processing.
      - Standards that’s been around since w3c – how they communicate
        via data exchange

**Use of SOAP header and body in RPC**

  - If I look at the actual body, what else do I expect - Number of    things in the body
  - First is all to do with business logic – what are you invoking, what’s
    the name of the methods, what are the parameters, what does it
    return?
  - In this case, the body contains a single element called method, and
    there’s sub elements that comes with it – could be parameters that
    are required by the receiving method
  - Types – must match what server expects. They need to agree on what
    to expect.
  - Response –business logic is supported by the server, server executes the
    actual call, and sends a reply back. Similarly, will have to contain
    values – these values could specify as part of the body.
      - Could be one element, sometimes it’s a whole XML or json
        document
  - End of the day your invoking a method, name, parameters, and ur
    receiving back a response with some form of convention with the
    server

## WSDL: Web Services Description Language

  - Information required by the client to build SOAP msg will need to be
    extracted from the service interface – therefore the client doesn’t
    have to scratch their head lol
  - **WSDL -** Describes the interface of a WS in a standard way that
    allows the client to understand how to interact with web services
  - Function of interface of WSDL is comparable to IDL (Interface
    Description Language)
  - Adds considerably to the complexity of web service
  - E.g. amazon
      - Without broker, you ask amazon for a document to build a SOAP
        msg.
      - Very long but its enough to have any service described in a way
        that you can take it and do sth with it – can take WSDL and
        write some code.
      - If I can get this WSDL, I may be able to use a tool, to extract
        what you need from it - which is usually the interface. This
        interface will look like a proxy or a stub. Which will allow you
        to invoke any of the method.
      - Q: which comes first – WSDL or the service itself?
          - A: service comes first – amazon writes the service, then
            they have a tool to generate a wsdl document
          - Then you use a diff tool to generate a stub or proxy to
            attach to your code – then you can invoke any of the method
            that is available


**Anatomy of a WSDL document**
  - May find definitions of element that describes a WS:
  - Import / \#include - to import extra elements that are needed by the
    service
  - Types - There is a type that defines the datatype of msg elements
  - Message – your invoking methods, what are the names of the methods
  - Port type– where you pair the rq to the reply – when there's an
    element called doit – <span class="underline">portType</span> may
    look like doit rq and doit reply – processer will need to know that
    when invoking doit, expect a request
      - We invoke through endpoints - have URI
<!-- end list -->
  - Binding – specifying operation style and transport protocol - amazon
    expecting me to stick to it.
  - Service – locate the endpoint – means the invocation of service
    through URI


## Summary
  - By using XML and HTTP – WS meets industry needs that other DS tech
    cannot
  - WS support loose coupling – facilitating SOA for the internet
  - Reviewed how SOAP is used to structure XML messages
  - Seen how WSDL describes a WS in a way that IDL describes the
    interface of a remote component
