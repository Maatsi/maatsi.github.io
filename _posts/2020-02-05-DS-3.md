**Goal**  
- To understand the different ways on how to view the organisation of a
distributed system.


**Introduction**
  - It’s all about software components and these components are
    software, apps, processes.
  - Components interact with each other, on a diff machine on a diff
    service
  - Software architecture – tells us how the various software components
    should be organized and interact.
      - Imp goal: to separate the applications form underlying
        platforms. To have ONE SINGLE COHERENT VIEW → through the
        middleware\!\!
  - Once you instantiate software architecture (placing soft. components
    on a real machines)→ it becomes a system architecture
  - WHAT ARE THE difference between them?


## Architectural Style
  - Formulated in terms of:
      - Components with well-defined interfaces
      - the way they are connected to each other – mechanism that
        mediates communication, coordination among components
      - data exchanged btwn components
      - how they are jointly configured into a system.

  - E.g. As the dff components can run on a diff machine, A run on
    machine 2, BCD on machine 1.
      - Component B interacting with D – local invocation. Share the
        same server and memory
          - Interface of D is made available to B – B needs a copy of
            D’s interface
      - When they are in a diff machine, A still needs a copy of D’s
        interface. Definitely\! Invocation has to go through a network –
  - Important is that components are connected, and provide
    **interfaces** so that other components can use it


### 1. Layered Architecture

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 9 30 46 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420534-84711400-4e43-11ea-8df6-498fe5f82727.png)

  -  A – pure layered organization
      - Only downcalls to the next lower layer are made.
      - In TCP IP, there are 5 layers. (application, transport,
        network, link, physical) and you can only talk to the next one,
        not n-2.
      - Layer n-1 will provide an interface to n, and if you wanna talk
        to me, u’d have to do it through this interface
  -  B – mixed layered organisation.
      - E.g. take layer n-1. There’s an app called A. this will invoke
        an  OS library  that’s available in
        layer n-3. AS WELL as n-3, A will call layer n-2,wihich holds a
         maths library . maths library
        itself relies on OS library in layer n-3\! So n-2 has to call
        n-3 as well.
  -  C – layered organisation with upcalls
      - Have a lower layer do an upcall to its next higher layer
      - E.g. OS signals the occurrence of an event
          - Its to do with **handle** – Its possible to subscribe to
            events, and when they become available, it gets an automatic
            notification.
          - This case, n-1 is interested in event in n-2, so n-2
            notifies n-1 that the event (handle) happened, using an
            upcall.

**E.g. Layered Communication Protocol**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 9 32 06 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420649-b3878580-4e43-11ea-9546-10c09d8b9ed7.png)
  - In TCP/IP protocol stack, each layer provides **services** and
    functions.
  - Each layer offers an interface and in order for n to invoke n-1, it
    exhibits an interface that could be used by layer n. but it has no
    idea how the functionalities in n-1 is implemented. What’s important
    is the **interface**\!\!\! And that it hides the implementation.
  - **Protocol** is a set of rules that parties will follow in order to
    exchange info. (communication btwn parties)
  - Important to understand the difference between a service offered by
    a layer

**Application Layering: the PAD model**
  - Taking a layered arch and applying in a modern software. It ends
    up as a PAD model
      - Presentation layer – **you** sitting in front of computer, and
        about to use a **browser**.
      - application layer – processing layer. When you send a search
        request to somewhere, it does a core functionality of a search.
        \!\!it will rely on other services that will hold the data.
      - Data layer – responsible for the storage where the app layer
        operates

**E.g. a Web Search Engine**
  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 9 32 38 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420695-c732ec00-4e43-11ea-84dc-049d431684f3.png)
  - RHS you have three levels: UI, processing, data
  - (UI) User types in a search keyword → (Processing) Query generator
    needs db → (Data) db query is taken care of → (Data) the info (page
    titles and info) is sent back to processing level → (processing) All
    results are ranked → (processing) generates HTML pages→ (UI) its
    passed back to UI level.


**A search on Google cloud: How it is handled**
  - **Query** is sent through google – in the **border router** of the
    google cloud, and it needs to balance the influx of query load.
    **Load balancer** tells you to go this way\!\! It will get taken by
    a **rack of servers**. And its sent back to me. This happens
    sooooosoososos quick\!
  - Hierarchy of the switches is very complex
  - Refer to processing and data level from prev\!


### 2. Object based style
  - Objects corresponds to components, connected and communicate through
    a **procedure call** mechanism. If two objects reside on the same
    system **→ method call,** over a network **→ remote procedure
    call.**
  - Object encapsulate the data **(state),** as they exhibit the
    interface, but neverrrr shows how its implemented.


**Architecture**
![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 9 33 29 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420779-e5005100-4e43-11ea-8da3-c249c132ff38.png)

Client-side stub (**proxy**)
1.  Client invokes a method
2.  Server gives a copy of **interface** to client → called **proxy**.
    Proxy is loaded into clients address space.
    - Proxy  marshal  the method invocation client made
    - and  unmarshal  reply messages to return the result of the method invocation to the client.
3.  The marshalled invocation is passed across **network**.

Server-side stub (**skeleton**)
4.  Incoming invocation requests are first sent to a **server stub
    (skeleton)**
    - Which unmarshals the invocation client sent, and actually make
      method invocation that client wants at the server through an
      interface.
    - Also creates a reply and marshals them and forwards reply msgs to
      the client-side **proxy**
- **Proxy and the skeleton** are referred to as **stubs**\!\!\! BOARD


### 3. Resource based Architectures
  - View a distributed system as a **set of resources** where machines,
     individually manged by components .
    Resources may be added, deleted, modified, etc by (remote) apps
  - Characteristics of **RESTful** architecture:
      - Resources need an identifier→ is usually accessed through
         **URI (uniform resource
        identifier**)
      - All the services offer same interface. e.g. put, get, delete,
        post
      - Messages are fully self-described. E.g. when sending HTML, say
        that it is HTML. Send its media type\!\!
      - After executing a service, component forgets about the caller
          - Once the sever gets the request, that server takes the rq,
            process it, sends back the resource and **forgets it** → is
            memoryless execution보드
          - Is prominent in web services and REST
  - Operations – put, get, delete, post → **CRUD operation\!\!** 보드
      - Create (PUT), Read (GET), Update (POST), Delete (DELETE)


**E.g. Amazon’s Simple storage service (Amazon S3) –** RESTful in practice
  - **Objects** (=files) are placed into **buckets** (=directories)
  - By placing a file in a bucket, file is automatically uploaded to the
    Amazon cloud
  - ObjectName contained in BucketName –access through:
    http://BucketName.s3.amazonaws.com/ObjectName
  - URI - Operations are carried out by sending HTTP requests –
      - PUT - request through HTTP
      - GET – to see if the object is contained in the BucketName
      - S3 – access a file in s3 web service
      - Specific object in that bucket called ObjectName
  - Simple as long as you know the URI→ in detail in further lecture



### 4. Event based architecture
  - As processes join and leave, its important that dependencies btwn
    processes are as loose as possible → hence, architecture that has
     strong separation between **processing** and
    **coordination**
      - So more of autonomously operating processes
  - Here we emphasize the **coordination**\!\! → it encompasses the
    communication and cooperation btwn processes and machines
  - Two design:
      - **Mailbox** coordination- 2 processors, to work and exchange
        info – they use  shared mailbox ,
        and they communicate through this shared mailbox
          - Write and fetch to the mailbox
          - No real communication btwn the two
      - **Event-based** coordination – coordination btwn processors will
        happen once the event occurs
          - Processer 1 **publish a notification** describing the
            occurrence of event 1, and if ur interested, you
            **subscribe**, and will be notified\!\! And will have access
            to it
          - Publish and subscribe

  - **Example of a Coordination Model: Shared Data Space**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420823-f47f9a00-4e43-11ea-9025-3131fb58a5e7.png)

1.  **Event based** architectural style – publish subscribe is key.
  - **Event bus** – mechanism which the publishers and subscribers
        are matched → what coordinates these events

2.  **Shared data space** architectural style – there's a db which is
    persistent and liable
  - The components will communicate entirely through **tuples**
      which is saved in a saved db, and other one does a quick search
      to see if the tuple exists any tuple that matches is returned.
      - **Tuples**: a structured data records with number of fields
  -  Can be combined w event based – process subscribes to certain
      tuples publish \&subscribe


## System Architectures
  - System architecture is the **instantiation** (placing soft.
    components on a real machines) of a software architecture. but how
    do I actually place them on hardware?????
  - There are 3 ways to organise this architecture: centralised,
    decentralised, hybrids


### 1. Centralised Organisations

**Basic Client Server Model**
  - One of the core organization of the system architecture
  - **Server** – process implementing a specific service – e.g. file or
    db service
  - **Client** – a process that requests a service from server
  - The way it works: Clients and servers could be in a diff machine –
    both follows **request-reply model**
      - Client sends the request, server accepts, server does the
        service, server replies → would take a bit of time
      - By means of a simple connectionless protocol- efficient.
  - But making the protocol resistant to transmission failure is not
    trivial

**2-Tiered Architecture**
  - UI is split btwn the client and server
      - E.g. if ur in front of the machine and filling in the form - it
        can be implemented on both server or client side prev lec
  - 5 diff ways to implement PAD model
      - A - only terminal dependent UI is in client side, but also
        exists in server side.
      - B – entire UI on the client side, which communicates with rest
        of the app through a protocol on the server. Client does no
        processing
      - C –processing is partly done in the client side. Front end
        checks for the correctness of the form, and more complex in
        server.
      - D – client is not only in charge of UI, but the processing\! But
        for data, gotta ask the server
      - E – client’s local disk has partly some data → doing a lot →
        **FAT** client\!\! Not good lmao
          - E.g. web browsing – build huge cache on local disk
  - If we have more functionalities on the client side, it has to be
    more end-user resilient, and has to cope with a lot of different
    platform, needing for a multiple version- hence not optimal.

**3-Tiered Architecture**
  - Client – application server – database server. Processing layer
    are executed by a separate server
      - !![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420901-1711b300-4e44-11ea-91b9-ab85ea0b9d51.png)
      - **UI** – sends request to the application and present the
        result to the user
      - **Application server** – doesn’t have the data although it
        understands the business logic. Get the data from db server and
        process it, and send it up
      - **Database server** – take the rq, process and send it to
        application layer
  - E.g. transaction processing. A separate process, a transaction
    processing monitor, coordinates all transactions across different
    data servers
  - Q: So how much did user wait??? And is the user aware that there’s a
    db server?
      - They don’t know\!\! Encapsulation

**Is 2 or 3 tier better?**

  - Depends on archi – but for good design, it’ll be better to have 3 as
    everything is separate.


### 2. Decentralised
  - **Peer to Peer (P2P) architecture**
      - They communicate, and could join and leave, but the interaction
        is always theatre.
      - There is no master node – processes are all equal → each process
        will act as a client AND server
      - Sometime process will need functionality hence would have to
        send the request


  - **E.g. Structured P2P**
      - Nodes are organised in an overlay with specific topology. E.g.
        binary tree, grid → for data lookup
          - Based on using semantic-free index.
      - Each data item is associated with a **key**, which is used as an
        **index**. Its common to use a **hash** **function**.
         Key (data item) = hash (data item’s
        value)
          - each node responsible for strong (key, value) pairs - thus
            implementing a **distributed hash table**
      - Any node can be asked to  lookup a given
        key , which then comes down to efficiently *routing* that
         lookup request  to the node
        responsible for storing the data associated with the given key .

      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 9 35 35 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74420968-30b2fa80-4e44-11ea-84b8-61d6418eafb2.png)

      - Question is, what happens when node **7** is requested to look
        up data that key **14** has? key 14 is stored on node 14. Key =
        node.
          - 7 is connected to 15, then 14 has to connect to 15→ two hop
            solution
          - There exists a **lookup table** that has a structure of the
            system
      - Want to find a shortest path from 1101 – 1011 → **routing
        problem** by using the lookup table which helps you decide the
        next node.


### 3. Hybrid
  - Need to combine centralized and decentralized→ we experience on a
    daily basis
  - Ideally ud like to have and ISP (Internet Service Providers) server
    very close to where you live – due to bandwidth and latency issue.
    So what we do is combine, we will end up in
     number of edge servers  all around the
    network. As a end user we connect to closest edge server that could
    serve me
      - Sometimes when the edge server doesn’t have the info I need, It
        will connect to another edge server
      - This is what the content providers tend to do\! Have the edges
        spread → Netflix
  - Interesting problem – how many edge? How do we optimize the content
    itself? And how do you distribute the apps all over the edges?


## Summary
  - Reviewed various architectural styles and system architectures
  - Discussed how the client-server model generalises to the idea of
    multi-tier systems
  - Described the logical layering of a client-server system according
    to the PAD model
  - Emphasized A LOT on client server model and the PAD model – to
    understand where UI, interface and the data is
