## **11. Naming I – Flat Naming**

**Goals** – understand principles behind a naming in a distributed
system

**Basic definitions**

  - **Names –** are used to share resources, to uniquely identify
    entities, to refer to locations, etc.
  - Entities – in any computer system must be given names if we are able
    to have access to them
      - **Entities** could be software, hardware, disk, file, page, etc
      - Name is a string of bits or characters -usually human readable
  - These names must bound to attributes – how does attributes define
    the actual name
      - Normally the attributes will give us access to that entity
  - Name is resolved when we translate it into those attributes – you
    are finding Mr. brown in the audience
  - In DS the implementation of naming system is often described across
    multiple machines.
      - How this distribution is done plays a key role in efficiency and
        scalability of naming sys
  - → The end of the day, aim is to access the identity through its name

**Name resolution example**

  - How can I resolve name in the content of that urL?

      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 8 55 53 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75286882-37ad1600-5811-11ea-842f-3f33df8542eb.png)
      - First thing is to try to look the server where the object or
        entity is - To access the server I need to know the IP address –
        there exists DNS look-up who tells you the IP address.
      - Second thing is the port, it may suggest that it's running on
        localhost-8080
      - Next is /products/catalog.html – there's a folder and there's
        this HTML file
      - → We try to resolve the name step by step
      - On a web server there's a file, and what do I need? I will need        to actually access the server, which is prolly sitting on a
        cluster – that IP address is gonna be translated into
        <span class="underline">network address</span> to access THE
        host machine itself\!\! we take the network address + port no to
        access actual host machine.
      - Ip address to network address translation is through
        <span class="underline">ARP</span>
          - Address resolution protocol – I took IP and translated into
            data link address to have access to host machine which helps
            you resolve the name

**Access points and addresses**

  - To operate on any entity – I need special kind of entity called
    access point  - The name of the access point itself is called address.
  - The entity itself can have more than one access point
      - E.g. telephone – access point, telephone number – address. you
        can have 5 phone number\!\!
      - In ds, access point – a host running a specific server, address
        – IP+ port no.
  - Entity may change its access points
      - E.g. computer move from one to another- diff IP address. I
        should be reachable – and bc mobile IP address keeps changing –
        so it may change over time
  - In general, don’t want to use an address as a regular name – coz it
    changes\! So we want location-independent name\!

**Function of a naming system**
  - Naming system manages set of bindings btwn names and attributes of
    entities in the system.
      - In simplest form is a table of (name, address) pairs
  - Primary function of naming service is naming resolution
  - Secondary functions:
      - To create new binding
      - Delete existing binding – name may say they want to remove that
        attribute
      - Listing of bound names
      - Can organize the namespace as I want

**Flat naming systems**

  - Entities are referred to by an identifier - and principles have no
    meaning at all – it doesn’t tell you how to locate the access point
    of its associated entity. could not be human readable
  - No structure and it needs special mechanisms to trace the location
    of entities

<!-- end list -->

1)  **Broadcasting**
  - It broadcasts the ID- a message containing the identifier of the
    entity is broadcast to each machine and each machine checks if
    they’ve got it, and send back a reply message with the address of
    the access point.
  - You require all the process and entities are READY to listen to the
    incoming call.
  - However, it doesn’t scale beyond the LAN – but in WAN with thousands
    of machines it will never work coz it doesn’t scale
  - Network bandwidth is wasted by request messages, and too many hosts
    are interrupted
  - E.g. **ARP –** Address Resolution Protocol
      - To find MAC address of the machine, you will basically have one
        of the hosts and say I need to deliver this data to this
        machine, who has this IP address


<!-- end list -->

2)  **Forwarding pointers**

<!-- end list -->
  - When an entity moves from A to B, it leaves behind in A a pointer to
    its new location at B.
      - Dereferencing can be made transparently to clients by having a
        chain of pointers – you keep track of where the entity is
      - Client keeps updating the reference of the entity – good news is
        entity is always gonna be found
  - Drawbacks
      - If no special measure is taken, a chain for an entity can be so
        long and hence expensive locating. → latency may be an issue
      - Intermediate locations have to maintain their part of the chain
        all the time
      - Broken links – one pointer can fail and the whole chain will be
        broken\!\!\!

  - **Example: SSP chains**

      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 8 58 25 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287035-91addb80-5811-11ea-8517-05c1a89732c3.png)
      - Each forwarding pointer – a (client stub, server stub) pair to
        access object
      - P1- P3- P4 → it leaves behind the client stub – if you want to
        find me here’s my stub.
      - Prev client will use the stub as a pointer to the next P’s
        server stub.
      - P2 is looking for the stub – could broadcast does anyone have
        the client stub? Then p1 has – p1 and p2 will have the same stub
        – and it will both point to P3’s server stub which leads you to
        P4’s server stub aka the object you wanna refer to.
      - BUT – there exists a way to make the forwarding pointer more
        <span class="underline">efficient</span>
          - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 8 59 08 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287091-ab4f2300-5811-11ea-9214-3b19e7a4a0d7.png) (a) and (b)
          - One may break coz it's too long – why can't we redirect the
            pointer by storing a shortcut in a client stub? - hence
            server stub is no longer referenced.
              - If it is found, it doesn’t need to go through all the
                pointer – it simply gives a copy of the stub
              - Communication is faster coz fewer process.
          - Once ur entity is found, the server can send some info to
            initial requester, and give a copy of the stub.
          - Let the object’s **home location** keep a reference to its
            current location.

<!-- end list -->

3)  **Home-based approach**
  - It approaches through a home – the **home location** keeps track of    where the entities are.
      - Communication to that IP address is first directed to the **home
        agent.**
      - Home agent is located in LAN corresponding to the network
        address contained in the mobile host’s IP address
      - Whenever mobile host moves to another network, it requests a
        foreign address (care of address) to use for communication


  - How it works
      - When home agent receives a packet for mobile host, it looks up
        host’s current loc. If its in local network, packet is
        forwarded. If not, it is tunnelled to the current location,
        wrapped as data in an IP packet and sent to the care-of address.
  - Whole mechanism is hidden and transparent\!\! – location
    transparency is high

  - **Example: mobile IP**
      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 00 04 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287164-ccb00f00-5811-11ea-8fb4-6eabb40af52f.png)
      - Assume there's an entity where the home origin is the states,
        and the entity is now in south Africa lol – and there are client
        in Singapore that needs to access to the entity that is
        currently in south africa
    <!-- end list -->
    1.  First, Singapore client sends packet to the host at home.
    2.  Host home will return address of current location aka Singapore
        AND at the same time, host home will tunnel the packet to the
        current location – forwarded or tunnelled
    3.  Then client will send successive packets to the current location - host name has played the role of intermediary agent
      - Aspect of tunnelling is v important


  - Problems
      - In large scale network, the home may be in complete diff
        location → increase in communication latency\!\!
          - What if this client is next door to south Africa – it's
            wasting resources\!\!why would you connect the US
      - Used of fixed home location – it always has to exists, if not,
        contacting the entity is impossible. The host itself could fail
      - Possible that entity migrates to the location and stay there
        forever – better if the home could move along to minimize the
        waste
      - Home address is fixed – it can't move to somewhere close

<!-- end list -->

4)  **Distributed Hash Tables**

  - The way we organise them is a logical ring – you have entities and they hold some information
      - We expect every node to be with a random m-bit identifier
      - Entity is assigned a unique key
      - Entity with key k – falls under jurisdiction of node with
        smallest id k – successor of k
  - We can make each node keep track of its neighbour – you start linear search along the ring
      - E.g. you search from 1 ,3, 4, etc until you get to 13 –
        never scalable and inefficient.
  - We will speak of node p as the node having the identifier p – we are resolving name through a key


  - Principles
    - Finger table – each node p maintains a finger table with
      less than m entries
        - Calculate and fill in by FT<sub>p</sub>\[i\] = *succ*(p+ 2<sup>i−1</sup>)
    - Forwarding: q = FT<sub>p</sub>\[j\] ≤ k \< FT<sub>p</sub>\[j+ 1\]
    - Or q = FT<sub>p</sub>\[1\] when p \< k \<FT<sub>p</sub>\[1\]

    - Example – resolving <span class="underline">k= 26 from node 1</span> and <span class="underline">k= 12 from 28</span>
      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 04 28 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287521-6a0b4300-5812-11ea-8b9e-3c884e7cad38.png)
      - Node 1 will look up k = 26 in its finger table, to discover
        that this value is larger than the last element of the
        finger table. So its forwarded to 18 which is the last
        entry. Then 18 will select node 20, as FT\[2\]\<k\<FT\[3\].
        Then, the request is forwarded from node 20 to 21, and from
        there to 28, which is responsible for k =26. (21 \< 26 \<
        FT<sub>p</sub>\[1\] 18) so q= 28.



5)  **Hierarchical approaches**

<!-- end list -->

  - Idea is to build a large-scale search tree for which the underlying
    network is <span class="underline">divided into hierarchical
    **domains**. - Looking to resolve an entity</span>
      - Each domain is represented by a separate
        <span class="underline">directory node</span>.
      - Top-level domain t – **root directory node** → knows about all
        entities
      - Lowest level domain – **leaf domain** – and the information we
        are looking for is usually here
      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 05 30 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287597-8f984c80-5812-11ea-8f42-c2615caed1d4.png)


**Tree organisation**

  - Address of entity E is stored in a leaf or intermediate node
  - BUT how do you lookup for the address of the entity? How to insert
    and delete?
      - Going back to the basics, tree structure, use concept of
        pointer.
  - Intermediate nodes contain a pointer to a child iff the subtree
    rooted at the child stores an address of the entity
  - Assumption is there's a root node, and is a point of entry, and it
    knows all about the entities
  - Eg – multiple addresses in different leaf domains
      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 05 55 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287633-9de66880-5812-11ea-8327-ab9172cdb3b5.png)
      - If entity E has an address in - 2 address in 2 leaf domain - E
        is replicated in D1 and D2.
      - Then the directory node of the smallest domain (M) containing
        both D1 and D2 will have 2 pointers, one for each subdomain (N)
        containing an address
          - The way it works is you can decide with entry node M there's
            two pointers aka children. And that N itself will help you
            store or locate the record of the entity you are looking for
  - Imp at this stage is to understand how to lookup operation works


  - **Lookup Operation**
      - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 06 35 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75287685-b6568300-5812-11ea-9fbc-636a95cb03ee.png)
      - Start lookup at local leaf node and work ur way up by forwarding
        the request
      - It may come as a request to this domain and this domain may or
        not hold the info I want – the node knows nothing→ then it sends
        the request to its parent. Then the parents say it needs to ask
        the root directory. In this case M, and m knows about it. Hence
        the request is forwarded to the child.
          - Right child, and helps you locate the entity you are looking
            for
      - Start always with a leaf and up to the tree to look for
        information


  - **Insert operation**
      - You have an insert request going to one of the leaf nodes. If it
        has no information, request is forwarded to the parent, parent
        contacts root node M and in this case M has a task to create an
        entry (coz its insert) so it creates a record and stores the
        address of the entity
      - A chain of forwarding pointers to the leaf node is created
      - Understand that the right child has info but not the left – one
        way to replicate that information

**Summary**

  - 5 different mechanism for flat name space
  - Name space naming service is v imp and the definition of
    attributes\!\!
  - Naming services allow us to bind a name to the attributes of some
    entity in a DS, and resolve a name into those attributes. Entity
    addresses should not be used as names.
  - Names can be organised into name systems
  - Explored various flat name systems
