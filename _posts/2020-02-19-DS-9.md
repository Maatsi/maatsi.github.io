## **9. Programming RESTful Web Services in Java**

**Goal** – Understand principles behind REST Web services programming in
Java

**REST: Quick Recap**

  - Rest is an architectural style which is based on Web standards and
    the HTTP protocol
  - In a REST based architecture
      - Everything is a resource
      - A resource is accessed via a common interface based on the HTTP
        – URI
      - The REST server provides access to the resources
      - The REST client accesses and modify the REST resources
  - Resource
      - Should support the HTTP common operations
      - Is identified by global IDs – URIs
  - Ur state changes so you can access more resources
  - REST allows that resources have diff representations, e.g. XML, JSON
  - The rest client can ask for specific representation via HTTP
    protocol
  - Importance of data encoding

**The Rest way of implementing the Web Service**

  - Putting order on a part, and ur interested in list – then URL1 which
    is the list
  - U choose the part and access URL2 as a resource
  - If ur interested, you put a purchase order
  - Important here is you r in charge of sending HTTP get or post.
  - All three are resources

**The SOAP way of implementing the Web Service**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753390-fabcae80-5267-11ea-9ce6-a19d2a5c7434.png)
  - All the overhead here
  - Message, envelope, web server, opens it, invoke the method
  - Main diff is here the resources are used using SAME URL – so you
    need to specify the method you are gonna use
  - All three are methods

**HTTP Methods**

  - CRUD – create, read, update, delete
  - GET – defines a reading access of the resource without side-effects
  - PUT- creates a new resource
  - DELETE – removes the resources
  - POST - updates an existing resource of creates a new resource

**RESTful Web Services – Examples**

  - Google Fit REST API, Twitter REST API, myMemory Machine Translation
    API, Public directories API
  - Might need to pay for it

**Data Encoding and RPC**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753412-027c5300-5268-11ea-8349-7504338b0a3b.png)
  - With **SOAP**, it is based on RPC – remote procedural call.
      - You make call to a remote object with necessary parameters, SOAP
        stack **serialises** parameters into XML and move the data using
        HTTP, receives response, deserializes it, and return
      - Data encoding expect to have both XML and JSON supported.
  - **REST** is very much on RPC side – you are accessing resource
    through HTTP protocol and that resource is identified as URI and you
    are still using a request reply protocol – to invoke a RESTful
    service.
  - They are still very close – RPC and REST

**Example Client Code:**

  - That accesses BBC news headline
  - That’s ur client and you need to know the API and stick to he policy
  - U look at how you connect, and know the method, and know the
    character encoding.
  - E.g.
      - Api key and attach it with REST API – newsAPI
          - U invoke a method called top headlines and you attach an API
            key
      - Set a connection
      - And id like to get a result as json
      - U will send the request method, GET, and get the top headline
        and connect to server itself
      - We need to get response and we need to understand what's in in -
        output it to however you want
      - Close connection
  - End of a day if I have a server
      - Api key
      - Opening connection
      - Read what's in it and output it
      - Now we need to look at json and extract what we want. – next
        step is to use a parser

**Java and REST**

  - Once I know how to write a program – we can say REST is server and
    client
  - There's java specification request 311 called JAX-RS
  - Itself uses annotations to define the REST relevance of Java classes
  - Idea is to use Class with REST style
  - Together with. Java Architecture for XML Binding – JAXB
  - We can take the specification and implement it
      - Make sure it's interoperable.
      - One of them is Jersey

**Jersey**

  - Reference implementation for JAX-RS
  - Contains a RESR server and a RESR client
  - Server side – uses servlet which scans predefined classes to
    identify RESTful resources
  - More importantly how jersey expects you to use concept of resources
  - http://your\_domain:port/display-name/url-pattern/path\_from\_rest\_class
      - ur domain
      - local host
      - display name
      - url pattern
      - path from the class
  - there are other things as well – RESTEasy, Struts, etc


**JAX-RS Annotations**
  - how do I know how to annotate the code?
  - HTTP relies on Post, get, put, delete – I need understanding and how
    I'm gonna annotate them
  - 7 annotations are enough to deploy a web service
  - @PATH(your path) - Before all this I need to set my base url
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753446-0ad48e00-5268-11ea-974d-5c8d9469b391.png)
  - @Produces(MediaType) – I define what media type is delivered by a
    method @GET. i.e. xml? Html? json? Plaintext?
  - @Consumes – it defines media type that is consumed by the method –
    which is usually a post.

**Example: Simple Calculator**

  - Restful needs to be exposed
  - Once implemented, you publish it
  - Then you need to write a client.
      - Calcrest – displayname
      - url pattern- calc
      - path form rest class – add/ sub usually a method itself

**Steps**

1.  Create the Restful Web Service
    1.  Looks like I'm gonna set the path to the base URL
    2.  Once I do that I create a class CalcREST and think of parameters
    3.  Add and expect 2 parameters
    4.  Id like to produce a media type – as a plain text
    5.  A method that is attached to addd get – this would expect 2
        parameters
    6.  And the method returns a+b
    7.  Second get – same thing to be done but the media type is XML\!\!


2.  Publish the Restful Web Service
    1.  We need to know where to access it – what's the URL – the fact
        that I attached URL is imp
    2.  I'm gonna start the server


3.  Create a Restful Web Service Client
    1.  Client can do add and sub
    2.  Gonna create a class and create client through that
    3.  Gonna create addService – which adds 2 and get the response
    4.  Through XML or Text


    **Testing the Service**
     - How do I write my client to use this service
     - With jersey, you can see whether ur service is up and running
      through http://localhost:9999/calcrest/application.wadl


**Data Encoding and RPC - More**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753692-6737ad80-5268-11ea-9cf6-be5ba53f04c4.png)
  - In the context of the cwk, some services support plain text, XML,
    json but others can support other data encoding style.
  - When you use these data encoding formats, you need to stick to their
    rules.
  - It's always to do with **data encoding and data serialisation. you**
    serialise ur data when you invoke a service and deserialise when you
    get sth back from the server → Importance of having a RPC style –
    send and reply, serialise and deserialise,
  - E.g.
      - Protobuf
          - Way of serialising structured data
          - Protobuf is in core of all internal RPC protocols in Google
      - Thrift
          - Software framework from Apache
          - Popular for services that needs cross-language service
            development - you develop sth in diff languages, and it
            supports a cross language services development
          - Comes with a code generation engine and allows ur software
            to write in various languages
      - Avro          - Data serialisation system
      - GSON
          - Google – Google, de/serialisation library just like JSON
          - Converts Java objects into JSON and back.

**Conclusion**

  - We looked at RESTful APIs and implementation of reference
    architecture- jersey
  - Insisted the importance of data encoding, especially when deploying your
own server - json, xml etc
