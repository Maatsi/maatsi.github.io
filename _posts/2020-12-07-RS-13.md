- What to show and how to show is called **adaptive content presentation**
  - **Static approach** – content is already there. How do we show them on the screen
  - **Dynamic approach** – need to automatically decide what to show to the user
    - Complicated, but this is where AI comes in


## Part 1 – Static approaches

### Adaptive content presentation – two steps
1.  **Content adaption** – how to select most appropriate content for
    the current user in the current situation, based on the user model →
    **algorithmic component of selecting the content**
2.  **Content presentation** – once you know what you want to show, how
    to effectively present the information in the user interface →
    **interface**


### Page based approaches
- Could be a description of the item, page, video, news item, etc
- Adaptation mechanism – selecting most appropriate page
- Closet approach to recommender system – a lot of predefined item, we
  select most appropriate, and we show
- Process
    - **Selection** – if content based, then we match the content,
      collaborative – we select based on what others have liked
    - **Presentation** – how we order them, how you render them on the
      page (layout)
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928032-d065c780-2d8a-11eb-993f-d986a6414a85.png)



**Example- KBS Hyperbook**
- Eg which uses page-based adaptation to illustrate the approach
- About particular aspects of programming – depending on who the user
is, appropriate content is shown → **adaptive information
resources**
- **Adaptive navigational structure -** All the pages possible for
showing is shown in the navigation
  - Colour – indicates the pages that are suitable for the user
- Not shown features
  - **Adaptive trail generation** – need to see this page then this
  - **Adaptive project selection** – to select a particular problem
    for user to work on, and based on that user can study appropriate page → second way of showing a bundle of pages
  - **Adaptive goal selection** – more related to user model – user
    can have several goals, and the system decide which goal is the
    most appropriate based on the goal, and it can give resources or
    paths to study THEN it can give adaptive project selection


**Page-based approaches advantages and disadvantages**

<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Advantages – versatile!!</strong></th>

</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td><ul>
<li><p>Widely used and is a mainstream approach – <strong>versatile</strong> approach</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content ins pre-prepared</strong> → have a control of what the user will see, in businesses etc</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to implement</strong> – you decide what to rec, and think how to order</p></li>
<li><p>Can be used with <strong>many user models</strong> - if we consider content pages being items you see a lot of models used</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>Content authoring is expensive</strong> – need to have a dedicated team which will think what the best way to present the content is</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency of model being static</strong> – if new users come, they might not be catered for</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content quality varies</strong> – depends on the authoring and the curation process. The curator might not know all contents → will cause deficiency of the problem</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  - So the next approach will challenge the staticness

### Fragment based approaches
  - We have predefined fragments, and we select parts and we bring the
    pre-defined parts together
  - Two strategies below\!\!

#### 1. Optional fragments

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928057-e96e7880-2d8a-11eb-8932-56de4fb4ac32.png)
  - Fragments could be anything – text, images, videos, etc – pieces of
    content that has been pre-prepared
  - **Selection -** Each fragment is associated with the **applicability
    conditions** (yellow little tag) \!\!\!\! the metadata that
    describes in which condition will be related so that we can pull the
    content
      - Red – selected, based on its applicability conditions
  - **Composition -** Once selected, we need algorithm which constructs
    a page from several different fragments together
  - → Have composed a page by pulling what's available from the content
    pool


**Optional fragments advantages and disadvantages**

<th><strong>Advantages – flexible !!</strong></th>
<th><strong>Disadvantages – static!!</strong></th>

<tr class="odd">
<td><ul>
<li><p>They are <strong>flexible</strong>. It gives element of dynamicity</p></li>
<li><p>Fragments are <strong>pre-prepared</strong>, so we still have the control of what the user sees</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fragment authoring is easier</strong> – rather than creating a fully pledged page !!</p></li>
<li><p>Could be <strong>crowdsourced</strong> – since they are smaller pieces, it can be created by different authors → could speed up the process of content creation</p></li>
</ul></td>

<li><p>The pre-<strong>defined conditions for each fragment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>User may be missed – could be created when the user model isn't available yet</p></li>
<li><p>Expensive/ time consuming – for every fragment, to create all the conditions</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Combined fragments may <strong>not align with one another</strong>, as it is from different authors</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Altering fragments**
- Page is constructed as a set of constituents → offsets some of the
  deficiency
- We don’t define preconditions for every fragment, but for **group of fragments**
  - Content suitable for novice, intermediate or advanced
  - Blue, yellow and red is associated with the level \!\!
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928071-f9865800-2d8a-11eb-886b-8220d0403580.png)


- **Step** – select, and put them together
  1. **Selection -** We select the **group (constituents)** – and decide
    which group is appropriate for the user
      - After selecting the group, we go on fragments to find
        appropriate fragments
      - Called altering bc you can decide from the group, which to
        select
          - Can do it randomly, in order etc
  2. **Composition**
      - Easier than optional, bc you can have layout of how you going to
        put the constituents
      - In e.g. put the red first then yellow \!\!

<li><p>Authors need to think of what group fragment will go to</p></li>

→ even the most flexible approach, altering fragments, suffer from
having to define the conditions when content is used



## Part 2 – Dynamic approaches

### Dynamic approaches– two steps
1.  **Dynamic content adaptation**
    1.  Automatic selection of content
    2.  Automatic structuring of the content – decide which part is
        suitable and how to present
2.  **Dynamic content presentation**
    1.  Automatically define relevance and focus – how to show what to
        focus and what's in context
    2.  Automatic media adaptation – which devices used etc
→ much more complex, so will just illustrate the ideas


### 1. Dynamic content adaptation

- Content **automatically selected** from:
  - **Knowledge base** – need to have some **relevance measure** to
    determine which of the objects from knowledge base is suitable
    (e.g museum example- need to decide which painting and what
    info, and other painting to bring)
  - **Bayesian network** – provides domain knowledge of what could
    be relevant to the user- gives a causal probabilistic
    relationship between the variables and can propagate from it,
    then decide which item is appropriate to show
  - **User preferences model –** match the preference model to what
    we know about the world and identify which preference has the
    most importance → weighted preferences

- Content **automatically structured**
  - **Task accomplished planner**s – bringing several pages together
    according to task and goals
  - **Argumentation models** – you know what objects you want to
    show, and this model helps putting it together in a coherent
    manner to convince the user
  - **Conversation theories** – brings interaction (dialogue) with
    the user to convince, or can present one narrative


**Example – GEA (generator of evaluative arguments)**
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928121-20448e80-2d8b-11eb-9e32-230117259789.png)
- Using argumentative approach
- First - Select what content is relevant
    - Based on **3. Preferences** – we identify which **parameters**
      are related
    - E.g. type of house, location, number of bedrooms
    - All the other parameters are suppressed
- We need to **convince** the user that this is best for them – like a
  story line
    - Story is building an **argument** to
      convince them
    - E.g. convenient house location, and compromise for user
      preference, traffic is moderate (strength of the house to
      compensate for the deficiency)
    - → **adding more conditions** related to house preferences & are
      **generated automatically**
- Convince that this house is best for them
- Level of detail will differ for users or for same user at different
  stages




### 2.  Dynamic content presentation
  - Key is to decide what is the **focus** in the user, and what is the
    **context**
  - **Focus** – emphasize the content that has been found most relevant
    to the user
  - **Context** – allow access to less relevant content to preserve
    context
      - Which user can go and stretch further
      - Stretch text – you have item in focus are stretched out, in full
        detail – page cursor close or stretch \!\!\!
          - Summary & purpose is stretched, but basic intro is closed
      - ![](media/image84.png)Scaling fragments, dimming fragments,
        summary thumbnail

**Scaling approach**
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928156-3e11f380-2d8b-11eb-8c9e-d12dcda191d2.png)
- How we present the focus and context – scaling
- The **fisheye** – visualisation technique
    - Is relevant but not the prime focus – is smaller and is blurred
      out.
    - The prime focus – shown with full size and highlights so they
      can read and grasp quickly


**Dynamic content presentation**
  - How to adapt to different **media factors**
  - **User specific factors** – visual impairments (careful of size),
    dyslexia (more images), autism (no long list of bullet points)
  - **Information specific feature**
  - **Constraint from media** – if its speech, we need to take into
    account the user listening environment, video then bandwidth,
    textual, size of the screen and how much they can see
  - **Contextual information** – who else is around the user (other
    interactions)
  - **Limitations of technical resources**
  - → need to bring those when we **automatically generate and present**
    it. Need to identify which are the most important ones for adaptations


#### 2 widely used approaches of dynamic content presentation
  - **Rule based approaches** – using rules to define how to combine
    /choose different type of media in which condition
      - E.g. dyslexia – structured diagrams and illustrative images \>
        long text
      - Tell us how to combine more than one media
  - **Optimisation approaches** – allow which items to put together, but
    how to best optimise the screen space and environmental constraints
    so that you can present most optimal media and **media
    combinations**


**Example – RIA – Real Estate Agent (media adaptation – optimisation)**
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/99928198-6ac60b00-2d8b-11eb-946b-a1beb2f244ed.png)
- Focusing the presentation on the screen
- How we **select the houses** and the characteristics of houses to
  show to the user
- Then we need a **mechanism on algorithm** to tell us how to render
  the screen in a way media complements one another
    - LHS – combination of several houses. On the screen and info is
      rendered so it isn't overlapped
    - Top side - **complementary text** → Optimisation – timing, which
      part of the dialogue and how it will correspond to images
    - RHS - The $499000 is the key information now. Everything else is
      stripped out → **optimisation is the level of detail & timing**


## Summary
  - The main adaption mechanism of the system – what to show and how to
    show
  - 2 main family
      - **Static** – predefined pages
      - **Semi dynamic** – predefined fragments
      - **Dynamic** – automatic content selection and presentation
  - Links to the recommendation algorithm, filtering and reordering of
    the contents
