**Recommender systems: Introduction**
- Problem: Too much **content** and **choices**
    - You want to direct the user and narrow to one or two arrows and
      to not overload the user the simple view of what the recommender
      system is doing


**Recommender systems**
- Families of the recommender system – to give an overview of algorithms
    of the recommender sys


- **Content-based recommenders**
    - Need to know about the content we are recommending Need
      representation of the content
    - Either have to obtain content and have an algo to analyse the
      content
    - E.g. email filer – need to know the content of the email,
      whether it should be filtered or starred
    - E.g. clipping services – how to cut the part of the content –
      just need to read about the simple things


- **Knowledge based recommenders**
    - Also need to know where to direct the user to
    - Also brings in <span style="text-decoration:underline">external world
      knowledge</span> – so that you can be more precise about
      recommending
    - If I have additional knowledge of cars, that basis and the
      knowledge will become content and knowledge-based recommender
    - E.g. buying guides for houses - If in addition to that you bring
      the world knowledge of types of objects, proximity to public
      services and etc,


- **Collaborative or social filtering**
    - It looks at social behaviours what other people has been doing –
      looks at attention of the others – and recommend what other ppl
      may like
    - E.g. amazon’s suggestion lists, top n offers and promotions


- **Hybrid recommenders**
    - Clever way of hybridizing the algorithms
    - If you have social data, you combine with content
    - Combine content and knowledge etc



**Content-based Filtering**
- So much content, and we want to narrow the choices of the user
- If we want to develop content based filter, you need **two things**
  in advance to be existing so that you can develop
  1.  **Content**
        - Appropriate information about the content so that you can
          map to the content
  2.  **User** **profile**
        - Need to know who the user is – good description of the user
          so that you can map the content to the user
- Then you can decide how each of the content is gonna map to the user
- Not only the user model, it has to be related to the content I'm
  showing
    - E.g. cars – and if you have the user model about the student
      grade, its irrelevant\!\! Need to know what kind of car, what
      brans they are royal to etc
- Correspondences between the user profile and what you know about the
  content
- <span style="text-decoration:underline">Analogy: give me the content that I would
  like</span>


**Content-based filtering II**
- Recommendations based on the correlation between the content of the
  items and the user’s preferences
    - E.g. recommend items similar to those I have bought or to my
      interests


- **Connection w the prev lectures – user models/ profiles**
    - Need to know how to extract the **user models –** explicit and
      implicit methods
    - To come up with a more plausible **user profiles** or **user
      stereotypes**


- **Description of the content**
  - It has metadata of the description of the content
  - Or think about ways of generating description from content
    information
      - AI algorithms – **classify the content based on key facts**
        – e.g. news about healthy living, politics, etc
      - May need to do that if the news don’t have predefined tags
  - Key challenge – what if you have **subjective opinions** in the
    content without the metadata. How do we classify them?
    - E.g. post on sns – no metadata that describes what's in the
      actual content. And you need to recommend the user the posts
    - E.g. how we book things – review – is subjective content.
      And recommend two or three reviews. Need to go into the
      reviews and see what makes a good review.
      - Processing that content and identifying textual
        features, then decide whether that’s a good review or
        not.
- Need to think these before you go into the algorithm's core part
- Correlation btwn the content and the user


**Architecture of CBF**
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708312-e31eb400-0c96-11eb-9825-98332f3a305c.png)
1.  When the user interacts through the interface,
    you have a clever way of **obtaining the user model** – through
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">explicit</span> by asking the user and
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">implicit</span> by analysing the interaction
2.  Then you have to have a **description of the content** – do I have
    the description? Is this reliable? Anything else I need?
3.  **Content filtering -** Do you have the areas of the content? There
    has to be a correspondence
4.  **Recommender** then takes the description of the content and the
    user model then starts **recommending** – identifies the one that is
    most relevant to the user
5.  May consider **user** **feedback** and to change it, and continue
    with the recommendation
  - Q: HOW can we do the recommendation?


### **CBF when user model is based on keywords**
  - **User model -** Assume that our user model is using the
    **keywords** (t1,t2,t3, … ) – have list of words from user profile
    that they are interested in, and we need to find the **weights** for
    each of the keywords
      - For each of the terms, what are the weights
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708337-f03ba300-0c96-11eb-81f2-e491f4e33226.png)what we know about that **ONE** user in
        terms of term \#2?
          - Wishlist, clicking, etc then we have to identify the weights
            through TFIDF
      - Match u1 with t1 and so on


  - **Item vector**
      - For each **item in the content** we have to get a vector that
        corresponds to that term
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708351-fc276500-0c96-11eb-987b-9c45122ef588.png) target terms, and how relevant those terms
        are to the item – for one
          - There are multiple items in one content
          - How close is this item form what the user wants
            **similarity**
      - item, we have w1, w2 etc – how relevant this item is to the term
  - How to identify the key terms and come up with numeric values for
    **users and for items** how we come up with the weights
  - The weights the input for the algo for the Content based filtering


  - **Calculating similarity**
      - The similarities between the two vectors of the same size
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708372-09445400-0c97-11eb-9bc0-715543ac9303.png)How close two things are together
      - Remember cosine similarities


**CBF when user model is based on Keywords II**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708396-12cdbc00-0c97-11eb-98f3-5b686d90ffa4.png)
  - For the first term, it has weight w11, for second term, w12 etc
  - The items are now the input to the recommender
  - How close the user is to the items
  - **Items to recommend:** sort it by similarities and take top k items



**E.g. How can we personalize student news feed? - Keywords**
- ratings
    - 0 – term not relevant
    - 1 – somehow relevant
    - 2 – highly related

1.  Identify the **terms**
  - (study (t1), sport (t2), well-being(t3), volunteering (t4), IT
        Services(t5), union(t6), equality & inclusion(t7)
2.  **User** – how interested the student is in mentioned terms
  - U = (1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1)
3.  **Item** – how related the news items are to the term; so we take
    **one item PER item for each item vector**
    1.  I1 = (1,0,2,0,0,1,1)
    2.  I2 = (2, 0, 1,0, 0, 0, 1,0)
    3.  I3 = ()
4.  So we do similarities between User U and I1, U and I2, U and I3.
    Then we sort it, take top items that are the most similar match up
    user with each item vector
- Q: how do you come up with the terms? How do you come up with the
    user preference?
    - A: we do **explicit profiling** – we ask the users to input the
      values
    - And **implicit profiling** – what news user is clicking on
    - You can improve the User preference that was given by the user,
      with results of implicit profiling


### **CBF when user model is based on Facets, values, ratings**
  - We start with the simple stereotype, and combine several stereotypes
    to come up with an inferred user model


  - **User model**
    - User model is values, facets and ratings that are relevant to
      the content
    - With facets AND values, we can specify it more now
    - User model is obtained from stereotypes which gives some facets
      with values and ratings.
    - __U = (\<u1v1r1\>, \<u2v2r1\>, ..)__ - values and ratings related to
      the content
    - **U = (\<study, UG, 0.7\>, \<study, full-time, 0.7\>, \<sport,
      team sport, 0.8\>, \<well-being, food, 0.5\>)**


  - **Item representation**
    - For the item, we need to know whether specific values hold for
      the facets
    - __I = (\<f1v1i1\>, \<f2v2i2\>, …)__ - facet, values and item
      relevance
    - **I = (\<study, UG, 1\>, \<Study, MSc,0\>, \<study, phD,0\>,
      \<study, full-time,1\>)**
  - Q: Now I have the user profile and description of each of the item.
    How do I match up these two?
      - A: Relevance with user and item


  - **Calculate Relevance**
    - Need some mechanism to calculate the relevance between you and I
    - !![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708414-1feaab00-0c97-11eb-964b-5301ed309a8f.png) rating \* item
    - So calculate 0.7 \*1 + 0.7\*0 + …
    - You have a representation of the user and the item, and you need
      a clever way of doing so


**E.g. How can we personalize student news feed? – Facet, Values and
ratings**
  - We need to decide what the facet and the values are

**CBF when User Model is based on Facets, Values, Ratings (cont)**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708666-d2bb0900-0c97-11eb-856c-5243eb5dfb61.png)
  - We have the user U, with user, value and ratings
  - We have items with facet, values and item relevance
  - Recommender calculates the relevance between the you and each of the
    items I1,I2, Im etc
  - Recommend top k


### **CBF when user model is based on Graphs/ concepts**
- **There's a graph representing the domain model**
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708683-dc447100-0c97-11eb-932b-de9c4be26981.png)
    - Concepts and links related to the content
- You can have more knowledge about the facets, more value tuned, it
  can be more spec
    - Team sport – what kind of team sport?
- It is a taxonomy, explaining various relationships – which gives a
  hierarchy and it allows to connect things
- **User model**
    - you = (u1,u2,un)
    - We would know what is relevant to the user blue is relevant
        - We have derived the positive hit of the user


- **Item model**
    - I = (c1,c2,cn)
    - What I know about the content; What item is the most relevant
- I have overlaid the user model on the content model (item model),
  and now I need to decide what that I overlaid on the graph is
  related
- Cleverness comes in here
    - Can think about similarities, similarity could be the part in
      the graph – if they have the same parent, OR they are similar bc
      one is a parent and one is a child node
- How similar the red dots are to the blue dots


**CBF when User Model is based on Graphs/Concepts II**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708736-f9793f80-0c97-11eb-8692-3c6c140e90f4.png)
  - Red – items with concepts
      - Could have overlaps between different items
  - Once you have both, calculate the relevance, sort it then recommend
    it

**Pros and cons of CBF**
- **Pros**
  - It focuses on just the user
  - Fairly easy to implement – once you have managed to obtain user
    and content description, can easily compare
  - ** Can explain to the user why they are recommending this – bc
    I have this facet and value, and that it is related to the
    item’s ratings
  - Applicable in a range of contexts
      - News
      - YouTube – you watch one video and they show you more of them
      - Travel recommendations


- **limitations**
  - Computationally complex - there are too many checks;
    similarity / relevance
  - Filter bubble – it might be too focused; it forces user into
    that one category
  - Cold start – you don’t have a user model to begin with
  - Reliability of user profiles – it relies on the user
  - Requires content description – facets, and have to do initial
    tagging; have to extract it automatically somehow


**Improve Efficiency: other factors**
- **Novelty/ surprise** of an item
    - Existence of information that is new to the user (e.g. in
      learning, video streaming
- **Proximity**
    - The number of links it takes to navigate from the current page
      to the page with the item
- **Context relevance**
    - How relevant is the item to the current items the user is
      interacting with (e.g. in news recommender systems)


**Summary: content-based filtering**
- CBF was the first recommender systems that is used in a number of
  practical applications
- Focus on the user – builds on user profiling \&Need description of
  content
- Main advantage – explanation of recommendations
- Main limitation – filter bubble
