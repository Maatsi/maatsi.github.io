## **5. Service Oriented Architecture**

**Goal:** understand the meaning of service-oriented architecture

**Recap: Conceptual design of software systems**

  - So far the model we adopted was to say that there's DS and we want
    them o interact, that supports PAD model.
      - Presentation layer - interface
      - application logic – business logic
      - Resource management – data layer
  - These three layers will map nicely to the interface that the user
    need in the system– interface, processing and data layers

**One-tier Architectures**

  - We take all 3 layers and build that into ONE system that combines
    all thee software system layers (=legacy systems)
      - Very long code that runs in one system – system will combine 3
        software system layers- PAD
      - Represented as a <span class="underline">mainframe host</span> –
        where we had the host directly connected to one big machine,
        which is connected to a unintelligent terminal (a dumb terminal:
        accepts data from CPU but almost no processing capabilities)
  - Idea is that it emphasizes a lot on the efficiency of the machine
    (CPU, system) – monolithic, and it doesn’t provide entry point when
    interacting except through dumb terminal

**Two-tier Architectures**

  - Take 3 layers, and one has to go out – separate presentation layer
  - Simply says with the advance of the PC, you can think about you
    sitting in pc (1), and pc connects to a server(2)
      - Server does app and resource management
      - U move presentation from server to client

**Three-tier Architectures**

  - Why can't you just map 3 system into 3 diff system?
  - application logic layer – sits on a middle tier that interacts
    with client and backend resources
  - application logic layer will facilitate many abstractions and
    infrastructure that supports the development – this is supported
    through middleware
  - Key concept is the concept of middleware – that makes it look like a
    <span class="underline">one coherent system</span>

**N-tier Architectures**

  - If we apeopley 3 tier model to full generality, we expect many
    servers at the app logic, many servers in resource management
  - What’s interesting is that app logic layer becomes itself a
    <span class="underline">server to the presentation, but a client to
    the resource management layer</span>
  - N- tier architecture arise from:
      - Situations when resource layer itself not only includes a simple
        resource like database, but when it also includes a
        fully-fledged two or three tier system
          - In the sense that resource management has db, network,
            storage data in itself can be implemented in the app or
            resource layer itself
      - Additional tier is created when you incorporate one server as
        part of the presentation layer
          - Meaning that you as a user is sitting at the presentation,
            presentation layer itself is regarded as a separate layer
            due to high complexity of the web service. These days its
            unlikely that when you interact with web server u. only
            interact with one – virtual server, two or three
          - E.g. Quick search on google – search is handled by different
            servers

**N-tier Architectures II**

  - N tier is Very much a full generalization of 3 tier archi, where the
    tiers can be a tier of itself
  - U realize that you can implement them and rely on middleware to make
    it work. BUT ur gonna rely on **standard** for the interoperability
    of the system
      - Standards are iMPoRtant\!\!
  - So, you may demonstrate the large amount of middleware to integrate
    multiple systems.
  - Finally, the fact that ur app logic is distributed across in
    multiple machine – and if app logic is distributed in diff machine
    and they have diff middleware too → then you need a system to
    integrate them all.

**Comparing the architectures**

  - Thesedays it could be 3 or N tier
  - Hw – you can look at the diff btwn 4 archi in terms of
      - Dependency
      - Complexity
      - And scalability

**Trends in system evolution**

  - Software evolved from monolithic → complex and decoupled n tier
    systems
      - EMPHAIZE decouple\!\! – no of components with diff functionality
        but they interact to provide diff functionality to you
  - Trends
      - Software is becoming complex
      - And it has to integrate with all sorts of systems, such as
        legacy system that is managed by diff administrative domains and
        reside in diff organisations
          - Tricky when all components are all over the place and you
            wanna integrate them – to address this → SOA

**Problems Addressed by a Service Oriented Architecture**

  - SOA - Simply means that today if we 200 studs that have software
    component, and his job is to integrate these components into a new
    app - we all have in java, python and etc. So why don’t you
    <span class="underline">turn ur component into a
    **SERCVICE**???</span> If it’s a service, we could just give an API
    to him, and u’d be able to integrate it all

  - As a **SERIVCE**

**Service-Oriented Architectures**

  - Is an architectural style
  - What app that uses SOA do deliver, is a functionality through
    services. And is used when building applications and services can
    be integrated when using apps
  - To ease the development, the apps are:
      - **Dynami**c - can change overtime
      - **Loosely coupled** – no dependency btwn them. Invoke first
        service then second service
      - **Potentially interorganisational** system– the eg with 200
        students, I can simply look at what's available. Google, amazon
        - what they do as an organization is that they provide services
        so that we can integrate it in our own applications
  - Paradigm shift from object-oriented systems to message oriented
    system -Is invoked through invocation
      - message to server→ server is gonna interpret and invoke service
        reply
  - Interesting is that all this works through ‘platform independent
    interface description’
      - We have no idea how the service is implemented thanks to the
        interface
      - What we need is the <span class="underline">description of the
        interface</span> so that we can use it and reply back
Remember remote procedural call
  - Slide with 10 steps: Marshal – serialise – gets to the other end –
    unmarshal

<!-- end list -->

  - If we put this into object technology – we have
    <span class="underline">RMI</span>
      - Client will have a copy of interface- marshall invocation-
        unmarshall- invoke method- send the result back
  - One talks procedure, other talks
    <span class="underline">object</span>

**SOA Vision -** How’s it gonna work w services? -through SOA vision

  - **Resources**- All the resources on the web that is available can be
    accessed

  - **Service** – once resource e is known, it provides services. Before
    we access it, we need to <span class="underline">discover</span> it
    (know it exists)

  - **Connectivity** – you could put whatever you like in the world, as
    long as you know that there's a service that can be invoked

  - **Technologies** – you have a tool that you can
    <span class="underline">build the services</span>, make them
    available and that they can be discovered and accessed. Then people
    can use these services, invoke it and integrate it as a part of
    their app

  - **Communities** – you have communities, with
    <span class="underline">operational procedures</span> where services
    can be invoked and can be used by the entire world

**Power Grid Inspiration for Computing**

  - This comes from the real world, we got the inspiration from power
    grid
      - Electricity is generated in a similar way – in a sense that its
        <span class="underline">transparent</span>.
      - If we plug it to a socket we don’t know where the electricity
        comes from - wind turbine? Nuclear plant?
  - Anyways the fact that its transparent is similar

**What is a ‘Service’?**

  - Reusable service component that can be used as a building block –
    and by using this, it could be THE app or the part of an
    application – interact w invocation
  - Service may be as simple as ‘get this for me’ or complex as ‘process
    a disbursement’
      - E.g. in module what web service is like
          - Anything you can think of – weather forecast, stock quote,
            etc
  - → Software component is supported in this logic and can be
    integrated thanks to an interface.

**The Cloud Computing Metaphor: Service Access**

  - The way we access the service is
    <span class="underline">transparent</span>– one side of the wall is
    me and u. we dunno what's happening on the other side of the all
  - impORTNACE OF transparency is key
      - behind the wall there are all sorts of machines – sensor,
        supercomputer etc
      - this is where the services get deployed so that it can be
        invoked on the other side

**Service-Oriented Architectures II**

  - ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691367-74a65680-51da-11ea-9292-1a21add261ca.png)

<!-- end list -->

  - Start by the **service provider** – who owns the service. Since it
    owns it, it needs to publish the service so that you and me can
    discover it.
  - So the service is described and is stored in a **directory service**

  - **Service requester** – would like to invoke the service
      - Search for the service through directory service→ gets the
        interface of the service → invoke the service by interacting
        directly with the service provider



**Service Provision and Consumption**

  - ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691381-8556cc80-51da-11ea-8ee9-d4b066cd1301.png)
  - Service consumer is LHS, and service RHs
      - **Policy** - Service itself before it gets published, needs to
        be governed by a policy – you use it this way\!\! And consumer
        adheres to it that you invoke in this way.
      - **End point** – service exposes itself, through end point
        (e.g.URI- address where service is invoked) consumer than binds
        to the end point
      - **Contract** – service publishes a contract aka, service
        agreement that is understood by the consumer
      - **Messages**–the business logic itself is implemented through
        msg passing, and consumer sends messages, service is invoked and
        result of invocation is sent back to the consumer as a message.

**Service-Oriented Architectures III -** Decentralised middleware

  - To implement this, we need a **middleware** – client is talking to
    server transparently
  - There's no obvious place to place middleware in 3 or n tier.
  - With SOA, middleware itself for interservice discovery and
    communication, is present within the hosting environment – it'll be
    very ez for the provider to say I'm hosting a middleware env, such
    that when you invoke my service, I'm able to respond.

  - → middleware is decentralised, its not in one place

**Service-Oriented Architectures IV -** Emphasis on loose coupling

  - In SOA it’s loosely coupled – interdependency btwn the services are
    NOT there
  - Due to the no dependency, you can easily add, replace, change
    services. → easy, dynamic and well structured
  - One thing to be careful is – <span class="underline">if sth
    fundamental thing changes</span> in the service, we need to ensure
    that the <span class="underline">interface DOESN’T change</span>\!\!
    Coz then ud have to change it for all clients
  - Modifications are much less likely to adversely affect existing
    services – flexibility is good.
  - Services once they exist, invoked, re-invoked, used and aggregated
    easily in diff ways

**Service-Oriented Architectures V –** adherence to well-supported
standards

  - Standards
  - With SOA, we ain’t gonna reinvent all sorts of things
      - We will look at traditional system – the way we integrated them
        is by standards, that necessitates middleware to act as a bridge
        btwn diff middleware systems.
  - With SOA since we have services form diff organisations, we can look
    at standardisation to make the invocation a bit easier
      - SOA organisations that has looked at SOA standardisation – OASIS
        and W3C.
  - → no need to reinvent the wheel but still there are organisations
    that are contributing to having a standard

**Summary**

  - History, 1,2,3, N-tier to SOA architecture with service provider,
    finding and interacting, Emphasis on middleware, loosely coupled and
    adherence to standards.
  - SOAs been there for long, and its mainstream when it comes to
    building and integrating apps.
