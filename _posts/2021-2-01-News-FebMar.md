##  Carmakers wake up to new pecking order as chip crunch intensifies
- **Who:**  Car manufacturers including Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors
- **What:**  There has been a semiconductor shortage infecting the auto sector, causing the carmakers to either pay up, stock up or risk getting stuck as chipmakers focus on more lucrative business such as consumer electronics.
- **Why:**  
  - As the chipmakers prefer the makers of consumer electronics such as smartphones, as they buy more advanced, higer-margin chips.
  - When the pandemic began, the chipmakers had to furlough staff and bear the cost of carrying idle capacity as the automakers cancelled orders in a slump.  However, as the economy recovers, they now want a large chip supply, which made the semiconductor industry turn their back on the auto industry.
- **How:**  Up until now, the whole semiconductor supply chain was centered around cars - however, now, they have an alternative - consumer electronics industry.
- **So?:**  
  - For more supply, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to write a letter in January to his counterpart in Taiwan to ask its semiconductor makers to supply more chips.
  - Infineon and Robert Bosch plan to commission new chip plants this year, which brings a chance of supply shortages easing soon.
  - Over the longer term, the relationship between chip makers and the car industry will become closer due to the adoption of electric vehicles and the need for more advanced chips.
  - However, there are no short term fix for the shortage, which puts the production of 1 million light vehicles at risk in the first quarter.

##  Google, Facebook battle Australia over proposed revenue-sharing law
- **Who:**  The Australian Government and the tech giants
- **What:**  They have been battling over a media law which would make tech giants to pay for news content.
  - **The law**
      - The AU news outlets, Facebook and Google can negotiate the payment for content used on their tech sites.
      - The tech firms are required to  give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms.
- **When:**  February 2021
- **Why:**  
  - To rein in the dominant tech platforms and preserve media diversity.
  - To watch over how the U.S. tech companies that dominate social media and search engines use news on their websites.
- **How:**  The parties can negotiate individually or collectively for a price agreement. if not, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable.
- **So?:**  
  - Australia is planning more regulation of large technology companies in the media industry - to challenge the dominance of Google and Facebook.
  - **Facebook**: They sent billions of clicks a year to Australian news websites. If this goes ahead they will remove new links from AU users' feeds.
  - **Google**: They are ready to pay for content, though no media orgs. have agreed to its terms. It will withdraw its main search engine from AU if the laws go ahead.

##  Facebook 'refriends' Australia after changes to media laws
- **Who:**  Facebook and Australian Government
- **What:**  Facebook will restore Australian news pages after the negotiation with the government regarding a proposed media law that forces tech giants to pay for media content displayed on their platforms.
- **When:**  23rd of February, 2021
- **Why:**  Both parties have come to an agreement after Google and Facebook's  unprecedented week-long blackout regarding the new legislation that challenged their dominance in the news content market.
- **How:**  
  - After talks between Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a concession deal was struck.    
  - Changes in the legislation, including that Facebook will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won’t automatically be subject to a forced negotiation.
  - That an internet company’s existing media deals must be taken into account before the rules take effect, which will encourage Facebook to strike a series of deals with media companies.
- **So?:**  The services are restored back to normal & The amended legislation will now go to the upper chamber Senate. Once approved, it will go back to the House of Representatives, where it could pass quickly, most likely this week.
