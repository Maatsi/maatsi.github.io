##  Carmakers wake up to new pecking order as chip crunch intensifies
- **Who:**  Car manufacturers including Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors
- **What:**  There has been a semiconductor shortage infecting the auto sector, causing the carmakers to either pay up, stock up or risk getting stuck as chipmakers focus on more lucrative business such as consumer electronics.
- **Why:**  
  - As the chipmakers prefer the makers of consumer electronics such as smartphones, as they buy more advanced, higer-margin chips.
  - When the pandemic began, the chipmakers had to furlough staff and bear the cost of carrying idle capacity as the automakers cancelled orders in a slump.  However, as the economy recovers, they now want a large chip supply, which made the semiconductor industry turn their back on the auto industry.
- **How:**  Up until now, the whole semiconductor supply chain was centered around cars - however, now, they have an alternative - consumer electronics industry.
- **So?:**  
  - For more supply, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to write a letter in January to his counterpart in Taiwan to ask its semiconductor makers to supply more chips.
  - Infineon and Robert Bosch plan to commission new chip plants this year, which brings a chance of supply shortages easing soon.
  - Over the longer term, the relationship between chip makers and the car industry will become closer due to the adoption of electric vehicles and the need for more advanced chips.
  - However, there are no short term fix for the shortage, which puts the production of 1 million light vehicles at risk in the first quarter.

##  노트북·태블릿, 코로나에 더 잘 나갔다

- **Industry:** IT
- **Who:**  한국의 가전 제품 시장
- **What:**  코로나로 노트북·태블릿 시장은 호황을 맞았다. 지난해 4분기 전세계 노트북 출하량은 전년 동기(4530만대)보다 **54%** 상승한 6970만대로 집계됐다. 4분기 전세계 태블릿 출하량은 전년 동기(4860만대)보다 **28%** 늘어난 6250만대로 집계됐다.
  - **MS 윈도** 기반 노트북과 **애플 맥OS** 기반 노트북(맥북)의 출하량은 둘 다 26% 증가했다.
  - **크롬북**:  연간 출하량은 3370만대로 전년보다 86%나 뛰었다.
- **When:**  코로나 19가 일어난 2020년
- **Why:**  코로나 19로 사람과 사람 사이는 멀어지고 사람과 화면의 거리는 가까워지면서 모바일 컴퓨팅 기기를 찾는 이들이 늘어났다.이 IT기기들은 코로나19로 재택근무와 원격수업(초·중·고 온라인 수업)이 ‘뉴노멀’로 자리잡으면서 수요가 급증했다는 공통점을 지닌다.
  - 또한 가계 지출을 줄이고자 중저가 제품 선호도가 증가하는 특징을 보인다.
  - 크롬북의 상승이유: 저렴한 가격과 다양한 콘텐츠를 앞세워 원격학습을 위한 교육용PC 용도로 조명받고 있다. 롬북은 비교적 저렴한 외산 브랜드가 주도하는 모습 - 에이서는 지난해 전국 38개 초·중·고에 6000대 이상을 납품했으며 레노버와 HP도 시장을 공략 중이다.
- **So?:**  
  - 노트북과 태블릿 시장이 코로나19 영향으로 맞이한 호황을 계속 이어갈지는 미지수다. 게이밍과 울트라 슬림 모델로 꾸준한 수요를 보여온 노트북과 달리 코로나로 신규 수요가 반등한 태블릿은 앞날이 불투명하다.
  - 교육 부문의 경우 윈도·iOS뿐 아니라 크롬까지 도입을 검토하고 있어 **OS 다변화**가 예상되는 추세다.
  - 또한, 노트북과 태블릿 모두 현재 전세계를 덮치고 있는 **반도체 공급난**에서 자유롭지 못하기때문에 안정적인 공급망 확보가 중요하다.
  - 재택근무는 신뢰할 수 있는 보안 환경에서 언제 어디서나 **기업 자원** 에 접근 가능해야 한다. 관련 업체는 **클라우드·가상화·워크플로우 최적화** 등 솔루션을 디바이스와 묶어 서비스 형태로 제공할 필요가 있다.

- **적용할점**
  - **산업 연관성**: 코로나가 오히려 IT가전제품 업계에는 기회
  - **직무 연관성**: 다양한 교육 OS에 맞는 유연한 플랫폼의 개발 필요
  - **자소서**: 반도체 시장의 수요/공급망 안정방법, 태블릿의 수요를 늘리기 위한 차별화 정책은 무엇이 있는지?
