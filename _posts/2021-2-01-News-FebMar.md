##  Carmakers wake up to new pecking order as chip crunch intensifies
- **Who:**  Car manufacturers including Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors
- **What:**  There has been a semiconductor shortage infecting the auto sector, causing the carmakers to either pay up, stock up or risk getting stuck as chipmakers focus on more lucrative business such as consumer electronics.
- **Why:**  
  - As the chipmakers prefer the makers of consumer electronics such as smartphones, as they buy more advanced, higer-margin chips.
  - When the pandemic began, the chipmakers had to furlough staff and bear the cost of carrying idle capacity as the automakers cancelled orders in a slump.  However, as the economy recovers, they now want a large chip supply, which made the semiconductor industry turn their back on the auto industry.
- **How:**  Up until now, the whole semiconductor supply chain was centered around cars - however, now, they have an alternative - consumer electronics industry.
- **So?:**  
  - For more supply, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to write a letter in January to his counterpart in Taiwan to ask its semiconductor makers to supply more chips.
  - Infineon and Robert Bosch plan to commission new chip plants this year, which brings a chance of supply shortages easing soon.
  - Over the longer term, the relationship between chip makers and the car industry will become closer due to the adoption of electric vehicles and the need for more advanced chips.
  - However, there are no short term fix for the shortage, which puts the production of 1 million light vehicles at risk in the first quarter.

- **So?:**  
  - Australia is planning more regulation of large technology companies in the media industry - to challenge the dominance of Google and Facebook.
  - **Facebook**: They sent billions of clicks a year to Australian news websites. If this goes ahead they will remove new links from AU users' feeds.
