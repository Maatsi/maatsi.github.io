- In this series of notes, it will cover contents about **software security**, such as:
 - **Cryptography**: the role of cryptography in security, modern cryptographic algorithms and their use in software development and encryption in computer networks.
 - **Risk management**: threat modelling and risk assessment.
 - **Modes of attack**: network protocols, malware and software vulnerabilities.
 - **Mitigation techniques**: counter measures, authentication techniques (biometrics and two-factor authentication), penetration testing, secure systems design and intrusion detection.
 - **Ethical issues**: ethics of security research, responsible disclosure and privacy.
