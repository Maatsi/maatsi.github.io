## Los Angeles to offer vaccine record on iPhones
- **Who:** People who get the coronavirus vaccine in LA
- **What:** They will be able to keep proof of immunisation in their iPhone's digital wallet, which is usually used for payment cards, boarding passes, or event tickets.
- **When:** As soon as the vaccination starts in LA
- **Why:**
  1. It will first be used to remind people to get their second required dose of the vaccine. (As it has to be done over 2 times)
  2. It could also be used as proof of vaccination in the Covid-19 hotspot of Los Angeles.
  3. Another potential advantage is privacy - the relatively simple pass system "can't actively perform surveillance, unlike smartphone apps" as it does no transmit data.
- **How:** The technology is enabled through the partnership with software firm Healthvana. Healthvana has a track record of handling sensitive patient data, having delivered millions of HIV test results to US patients in recent years.
- **So?:**
  - But there also has been some resistance to the idea of "vaccine passport" as some fear that they will be denied an entry to venues if they are unwilling to share personal medical information.
  - But problematic as the digital vaccine record feature is not available on all phones, including Android users.
  - And there is no way to prove that the person holding the phone is the same person who received the vaccine, without some other identifier.
