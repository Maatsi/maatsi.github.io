## **14. Timing and Synchronization**


**Goal** – to understand principles behind timing and synchronization in
a DS

**Time in a DS**

  - We have DS and have 4 machines and it will give 4 diff time as they
    have their own global time → hence time is unambiguous in a
    centralised system.
  - In order for these machines to work, we need a mechanism so that
    there's some form of agreement on global time
  - Q: is there any way of synchronizing all the clocks? YES\!

**Example**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 18 25 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288487-5cef5380-5814-11ea-87e8-ce9bc9889087.png)
  - Suppose you ask machine 1. It gives T1. A bit later when you ask, it
    will give T2. And its guaranteed that T1\< T2.
  - Take the scenario where you write a C code on a machine, in a
    computer which editor runs. This is the time according to a local
    clock on machine which the editor runs.
  - If I run compiler on a diff machine, problem here is that tools such
    as make will always look at the timestamp of output.c before
    compiling, to decide whether to compile or not.
      - If the input.c has time 2151 and input.o has 2150, make knows
        that input.c has changed hence it compliles.
      - BUT if 2 machines have diff time, and compiler’s machine is
        earlier, it would not compile even if the changes have been made
        in the file, due to the clock.
  - Fact that 2 machines aren’t synchronized bc event happens afterwards
    → causes inconsistency\!\!
  - With thousands of machines, to work together and share resource,
    time is paramount, and they have to synchronize often

**Internal Physical Clock**

  - Machines these days have built in time hardware called a
    <span class="underline">precisely machined quartz crystal.</span>
      - Internal clock on PC has a crystal and it oscillates. There's a
        tension due to oscillation, which oscillates at a well-defined
        frequency.
  - Each oscillation will decrement a counter by 1.
  - What happens when it gets 0? Can simply generate timer interrupt or
    clock tick and counter is reloaded from a holding register
  - Battery powered CMOS RAM – complementary metal oxide semiconductor –
    it runs on RAM will always store a number of ticks since a known
    date, which allows the system to maintain the notion of time.
  - In older machine, there's a reference where this internal clock will
    always reference to, which is called epoch, first generated in
    1/1/1970.
  - If you have DS with n machines, each machine has crystals and each
    crystals will run at slightly different rates → results in ambiguity
    which we refer as clock skew

**Time Standards**

  - Before 1958, notion of time was always based on mean solar second.
  - Since the invention of atomic clock – 1 second is defined as the
    time for a ‘caesium 133’ atom to make 9 billion electronic
    transition
  - If we are able to define atomic and solar second – can we agree on
    it being mapped?
  - History – BIH – Bureau International Heure – if all the people
    gathers and says tell how many ticks their atomic clock ticked and
    take the average. → International Atomic Time (TAI)
  - Why are we doing this?
      - Bc the mean solar time would need semantic – the concept of time
        is changing bc the atmospheric change, the amt of coal, hence
        the notion of time needs to be caught up
  - Hence BIH introduce leap seconds whenever discrepancy between TAI
    and means solar time reaches 800ms. → we need to artificially
    introduce a second

**The Worldwide standard for time: UTC**

  - There is discrepancy and mean solar and TAI do not agree. If this
    difference \>800ms, then we introduce a leap second.
      - 31<sup>st</sup> of December midnight – we introduce leap
        second\! Without us knowing,
  - If we take time based on the TAI and introduce leap time – this
    corrected time IS the time and is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)–
    the time u, me, mobile phones etc reference
  - UTC synchronise signals need to be broadcasted so we know what time
    it is. It is broadcasted through radio transmitters and satellites.

**Clock Synchronization Algorithms**

  - If we know the UTC, we can synchronize our time.
<!-- end list -->
1.  One is to have a machine with UTC receiver, we can connect to a
    satellite and ask for UTC → Cristian
2.  OR machines in DS have no UTC receiver, so you need to make an
    agreement on global time → Berkeley
<!-- end list -->
  - → The point is to always minimize clock skew
  - E.g. of skew – difference of 10<sup>-6</sup> per second. you will
    end up with 1 second in every 11.6 days – could be 1 sec behind or
    faster

**Synchronization model**

  - Assumptions: DS with n machines and own clock and timer, and it
    issues **H** interrupts per second.
  - Interrupt handler adds 1 to software clock, and keeping track the
    number of ticks since some standard time in the past – value of
    clock is **C.**
  - At UTC time **t**, the value of ith clock in the system is
    **C<sub>i</sub>(t)**
      - Ideally, **C<sub>i</sub>(t)** **= t + γ** for all i and t in
        every DS.
      - The variation of dc/dt is always 1\!\! Which means everytime
        there's a tick, there's 1 tick. Then there's a clear
        synchronization
  - However, in practice there are some variations, resulting a drift.
      - Bc their frequency is not perfect and affected by external
        sources such as temperature, clocks on different machines will
        gradually start showing different values for time
  - Variation of tick over time/ and 1-ρ → where ρ is a maximum drift
    rate.
      - 1−ρ ≤ *dC*/*dt* ≤ 1 + ρ
      - Its ahead or behind.
      - Since we are looking at number of TICKS. So, 61 ticks mean it’s
        faster.
  - E.g. 1 hour = 3600 second.
      - 1 second = 60 ticks. → 216000 ticks per hour
      - If I have a relative error which gives about 10<sup>-5</sup>,
        within an hour we end up with 2 ticks as my maximum drift rate.
        This means that in my DS, I can have clocks that are generating
        215998 and 216002 ticks.


**Drift as a function of UTC**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288551-7d1f1280-5814-11ea-92ce-5dc9b0413dcc.png)
  - It'd be easy to have a perfect clock where dc/dt = 1, slow clock
    when \< 1, and fast clock when \>1.
  - When UTC is drifting in diff direction, at a time ∆*t* after
    synchronization, they must be as much as 2p∆*t* apart.
  - This can be a concern in DS coz if you are not careful about clock
    skew, this may lead to some catastrophic event.
      - There was a software error in the clock, and it was a time for
        missile, and this has killed 100s of people.



**Cristian’s Algorithm**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288576-8a3c0180-5814-11ea-8c53-93d89f91960b.png)
  - A client with process running and time server running the
    processors.
  - Server has UTC, and at intervals not exceeding ∆C/2ρ sec, each
    machine requests current time to UTC server
  - Server gets the request and look at UTC and sends back.
  - Bc by the time server’s time gets to the client, the time would’ve
    passed. And there could be a network delay. Client needs to ensure
    that that delay is taken into consideration.
      - So what client does is they estimate the round trip time. Set a
        timer and calculate the time, and take half and add it to the
        UTC time that server sends.

**Propagation time**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 20 02 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288599-9627c380-5814-11ea-9d32-98a5433d2b57.png)
  - T0 sends the request, server gets it hand handles it, with I –
    interrupt handling time. It then sends back the current UTC to T1.
  - End of the day if you know the time client sends and receives the
    request, and if you can handle the interrupt handling time, you can
    calculate the propagation time.
  - (T1-T0-I)/2, where I is time that server needs to handle the
    interrupt

**Berkeley Algorithm**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288614-9fb12b80-5814-11ea-9fff-2c7aa6705c2a.png)
  - Easy to implement coz there is no UTC server
  - There's always the leader- the time daemon.
<!-- end list -->
1.  Daemon asks each machine for its current time. And each reply with
    their clock time.
2.  Based on the answer daemon calculates the difference in time and
    sends the NEW time to all the other 2 including itself.
      - You add all of them, 0+25-10 / 3 = +5.
3.  Then daemon tells everyone how to adjust their clock.
      - What happens now is the time daemon sets it global time to 3;05.
        And other clocks as well to 3:05.
<!-- end list -->
  - Problem is, it won't scale. Too much overhead due to too much
    messages in btwn

**Election Algorithms**

  - Deciding who is going to play the daemon
  - In DS there's a need for a coordinator. Hence, we use election
    algorithm to pick a coordinator (leader election)
  - E.g. Take over the role of a failed process, pick a master in
    Berkeley clock synchronization algorithm. → through election
    algorithm: Bully algorithm.



**Bully Algorithms**

  - Ds machines all have unique numerical ID, and the processes
    communicates with each other, through a reliable connection.
  - The key idea is it selects the highest id, and this one will start
    the election.
      - If it realises that the corrdiantor failed, the election is
        initiated.
      - 3 msg types – election, OK, I won
      - Several processes can initiate an election but need a consistent
        result to have one elected leader
  - O(n<sup>2</sup>) – quite large complexity, coz it needs to talk to
    each other
  - Steps
      - P sends election messages to all process with higher ids and
        waits for OK messages
      - P becomes the cord if no OK was received and send out I WON, or
        if it receives OK, the higher ID will take responsibility

**Bully Algorithm Example**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 21 08 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288684-be172700-5814-11ea-8511-e21f73982178.png)
  - You have 8 processes, and imagine that process 7 was the coordinator.
    But process 7 crashed and can't be a leader. Then processes realized
    this failure of 7 due to timeout, so 4 holds the election. It calls
    process 5 and 6, and they respond and tell 4 to stop. And 5 and 6
    each holds election. Since they dunno 7 crashed, they send request
    to 7. 6 tells 5 to stop as 6\>5. 6 wins and sends everyone ‘I WON’
    to all the system
  - As long as you have semantics attached to msgs you send, you good

**Network Time Protocol**

  - Enables clients across internet to be synchronized to UTC.
  - If we have a hierarchy of servers, and each server will connect to a
    primary, you are guaranteed that at some point the UTC becomes more
    accurate and accurate.
      - Need mechanism for servers to talk to each other and request
        this UTC \!\!
  - It provides a reliable service that can survive losses of
    connectivity
  - Authenticates timing data to protect against malicious or accidental
    interference with service
  - Protocol; will allow clients to resynchronise sufficiently
    frequently to offset drift rates common to most computers

**Structure of NTP**

  - Servers form a logical hierarchy – called synchronisation subnet.
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288714-ca9b7f80-5814-11ea-8053-a703cfa6a5a0.png)
  - Primary server – Stratum 1 - They are directly connected to a time
    source, such as radio clock reviving UTC. Server that has the most
    accurate time. – ntp2.ja.net
  - Secondary server - Stratum 2 – connects to stratum 2, and
    synchronise with primary servers
      - dnsserv2.leeds.ac.uk connects to ntp2.ja.net
  - Stratum 3 – another server that syncs to stratum2.
      - Feng gps connects to dnssrv.
  - Idea is leaf servers would be the one to be executed in users’
    workstations.
  - Accuracy decreases as we move down through the strata.

**Summary**

  - There is **no global agreement on time** in a DS; internal clocks of
    a system’s computers will run at different rates.
  - **UTC** provides an external global standard, to which we can
    attempt to synchronise a DS.
  - **Cristian’s algorithm** can be used to synchronise machines on a
    LAN to the UTC time received by a time server.
  - The **Berkeley algorithm** can be used to achieve reasonable
    consistency in the clocks of machines on a LAN, without
    synchronising to UTC.
  - **NTP** provides a decentralised time service suitable for
    synchronising machines on the Internet.
  - Introduced the notion of election as well as the **Bully algorithm**
  - Alternative of Bully algorithm is the **Ring Algorithm**
  - Question: can you explain this alternative algorithm?
