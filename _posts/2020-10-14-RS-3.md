## **User models and profiles (representation)**


**User models – three broad questions**  
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707771-6808ce00-0c95-11eb-88f8-6af266cd7e40.png)
1.  \*What is being modelled?
    - The nature of information
2.  \*How is this information represented?
    - In what structure
3.  How to construct and maintain these user models?



**What can be modelled in a user model/ user profile**
1.  [Knowledge](#1-knowledge)  
2.  [Interests](#2-interests) – came from recommender system, profile of the user
3.  [Goals and tasks](#3-goals-and-tasks)  
4.  [Background](#4-background)  
5.  [Individual traits](#5-individual-traits)  
6.  [Context of work more context adaptive](#6-context-of-work-more-context-adaptive)


## 1. Knowledge
  - Most popular in learner modelling in adaptive education system, and
    could vary how we represent it.
  - We need to have a __domain of area__ we
    want to map. Domain should be supplied to the system; as a list or
    **scalar** **models**

**Scalar models**
  - Scalar models – categories, numbers which is associated
  - e.g. in evaluating language proficiency
      - Categorical - Unix commands (novice - beginner -
        intermediate-expert) qualitative
      - Numeric – No.of years doing x (0,1,2,3,4) quantitative
  - Based on these values you can assume the proficiency / knowledge


**Structural models – graphs**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707799-79ea7100-0c95-11eb-94b8-67993f2e5fcb.png)
  - In graphs, we have:
      - **Nodes** – key entities and concepts in the world
      - **Links** – relevant nodes, or can name the links
  - and create a graph based upon it
  - Have graphs from outside and check if user knows these concepts, and
    we **overlay** the graph model on top each other
      - We overlay user/ learner knowledge with the domain knowledge (or
        expected expertise)
  - Counting the relationship and checking it and based on how many we
    know we overlay on top of entities, and we count how many concepts
    each person know

  - E.g.
      - User knowledge - indicating something about the user and the info that
        user may know. So the fact that she's German
      - Expected knowledge – Since she is German, so she’d know BMW


**Exercise – User model of UoL**
  - Wikipedia has a vast amt of information. And wiki takes the
    knowledge and plots wikidata (as a model)
  - Steps
      - Build a graph model for domain knowledge (what are the nodes and
        how they are linked) structure
      - Your own model will be an overlay model over the domain model

  - Types of knowledge – declarative vs procedural
      - \* **Declarative** (what we cover) – represented by networks of
        concepts (i.e. facts and their relationships)
      - Procedural – represented as a set of problem-solving rules

  - Knowledge model of UoL
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707807-8242ac00-0c95-11eb-8c87-b9842a91f886.png)
      - Binary (do they know? Yes or no)
      - Categories (how well do you know (+++ know well, ++ some
        knowledge, - no)




## 2. Interests
  - Most popular in information-oriented systems (e.g. recommendation
    system)
      - News rec, item rec, interesting travel guide
      - Could have shallow or deep level like user model
  - Interest is just a list of **keywords**. Can aggregate the list of
    keywords that indicates user’s interest
      - E.g. news - What kind of news user is reading; can look at title,
        metadata and gain list of words. user interest could be most
        frequent word\!\! **key word based**
  - Pull it further to **concept based**
      - Those keywords to be a concept, you need a knowledge beyond/
        behind, which comes from knowledge source. (wikidata, google)
      - Have external knowledge graph, you mark that word or phrase and
        map it to a concept; you have a lot around that concept gives
        richness around that word
      - It gives **richness**. So next time you read about oil crisis you can
        approximate and pull another news coz you know that user is
        interested
  - Concept level is more powerful in reasoning hence adaptation– if I
    have concept and relationship you can jump from to another
  - Can stay in keyword and look for **synonyms**, and could be
    integrated within that business
      - Either manually create the list of synonyms or use existing
        source of synonyms

**Interests II**
  - If we have concepts, we will overlay on top of concepts;
      - We don’t know if they know it or not, we know that these
        interests them
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707821-8ec70480-0c95-11eb-8414-a7268de2dc63.png) concepts and knowledge
  - Using **overlay model** over a structure
      - **Knowledge** - Can have all the keywords of the system and
        overlay those with user’s interest
      - **Concepts** – have all the concepts and their relationships in
        the system and overlay
          - Smartness of having knowledge behind it is that, if I know
            user has interest in certain nodes, you can go up and
            approximate and if the users are interested

  - Challenge – you usually have a limited interaction with the user
      - Have short session w the system and very little detail about their
        interests **sparsity**
  - You may not have the exact items user are interested; hence you need
    some sort of **similarity** to provide to user
      - To overcome So in concept, connected node; for list of
        knowledge, similar words
      - Some form of categorization of the list


**Exercise – user model on interests in Leeds**
  - Taxonomy limits the knowledge to those that has **inheritance**
    (instances); but makes it easier to process
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707846-a7371f00-0c95-11eb-9496-5f11f69f4d6f.png)


  - Problem with the model
      - Graphs are **complex** coz it has relationship + goes up. When you pull external taxonomy, it could be very rich. So you need to know how far up you'll go
      - External source could be **noisy** and has **limited data**
      - Users don’t talk in terms of groups, and human settlement so if
        system starts using this it can be an **understanding
        challenging**


## 3. Goals and tasks
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707858-b1f1b400-0c95-11eb-832e-c40bb4375c3b.png)
  - Most challenging/ changeable as goal/ task recognition is difficult
  - Usually modelled with a ‘goal catalogue’
    approach (predefined list/ structure of user goals and tasks)
  - To mark users goal somewhere in the catalogue then activate
    appropriate adaption (e.g. a learning system, help system)
  - Have **goals** and **sub goals**, with a tree structure
  - Challenge is to <span style="text-decoration:underline">find where the user is in
    the goal map</span> and how far they’ve accomplished

  - **e.g. SQL tutor**
      - There's a simple goal on top and based on tasks users have
        accomplished, identify the user goal

**Goals and tasks II**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707878-c03fd000-0c95-11eb-8138-18aec2a4bd33.png)
  - Using an overlay model with predefined goals or tasks
  - How to approximate that they’ve accomplished the goal?
      - Graphs or lists
  - Goal system with Bayesian network – and use some probabilities to
    except to what extent users have gone over the goals and sub goals

**Exercise – transport guide**
  - Q - What will the user model look like if we want a ‘**transport
    guide’** software to adapt to the user when advising on
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">how to get around in Yorkshire</span>?
      - Goal – types of transport
          - Sub goal – tasks to use the transport
      - Goal – locations you wanna visit
          - Sub goal – how to get there
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707895-cf268280-0c95-11eb-96cd-506d80e76ddd.png)


## 4. Background
  - Relatively stable information about <span style="text-decoration:underline">their
    previous experiences</span>
      - Profession, experience of work in related areas, opinions
      - Demographic information – name, age, sex, nationality
      - To put it in some form of category
  - Common to use user’s background for stereotype modelling (not
    overlay)
  - Challenge? Privacy \!\! hence not popular


## 5. Individual traits
  - Relatively stable characteristics of the user info which together
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">define a user as an individual</span>
      - Characteristics such as cognitive styles, learning styles,
        personality etc
      - Can be based on psychometric tests
  - E.g. If someone is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated
      - Intrinsically – turn on values, e.g. if I do well my fam will do
        well
      - Extrinsically – just wanting awards

  - Personality model
      - E.g. Introvert, extrovert, fast thinker, future thinker
      - Personality is useful when: you are trying to convince someone.
        If they are future/ present thinker you recommend it but tweak it.


## 6. Context of work
  - Context awareness is paramount for mobile devices
  - Is more like a holistic model
  - User model is more individual, but to personalise we need to know
    the individual AND **the world**
      - Hence contextual awareness
  - Early work started from platform adaptation issues, then has grown
    to mobile and ubiquitous adaptive systems
  - Now extending to other dimensions of the context such as:

      - **User location** – where is the user and what do I know about
        that. i.e noise level
          - E.g. Delivering video-based lecture I a mobile device and
            how long students are gonna consume the video. In a café,
            room, etc. It’s not a desktop app so we need to change sth.
            One of the things is to break it down to a smaller entity

      - **Physical environment** - Is it a noisy environment? Lighting?

      - **Social context** – in Facebook recommendations based on what
        your friends are doing. Recommendation based on your social
        cloud. Could be used for movement, who’s nearby and who should
        it be directed to

      - **Affective s**tate – can we detect the mental state of the
        user. We can model with some approximation from i.e. user’s
        speech – positive and negative sentiment
          - Problem – what do we do after that. After we've found out if
            the user is happy or not, back to the application and how
            are we gonna change it?

  - You only bring one parameter of context each time
      - No social context and physical environment together, bc we don’t
        know how to deal with so many things
      - E.g. medicine – we don’t give handful of medicine we give pill
        by poll
      - We isolate parameter by parameter to see what works
  - \+ While not totally about the user, the addition of the context
    makes adaptation more effective


**Dimensions of context**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707906-d8afea80-0c95-11eb-90f0-fd17ce0355a0.png)
  - Can take it from the context of the user (right) and see how far you
    can stretch further
      - **Task/ goal**
      - **Personal context** – interesting coz it can bring issues like
        disability, mobility and vision
      - **Social context** – anything about the time, location
      - Overall platform/ ecosystem
          - **Time/ location** - when, where, how long they’ve got
          - **Physical env** – noise? Dim?


  - OR take it from the context of the device (left) and see how far you
    can stretch further
      - Capability of the **device** – we use the performance of the
        device
          - E.g. smart watches – very limited screen, so need to be aware
            of that
      - **Environment context** – noise, pollution, movement, crowd
      - **Human context** – what are the influences that may affect the
        person?
  - Can start with something that is easy to capture and handle
    (task/goal, device) and you stretch further


  - Q - Personalised travel assistant – which context dimensions will
    you use? Past exam Q
      - From the **user model** – some demographic, **INTEREST** about
        places\! main thing
      - Personal context – mobility problems? (imp in this case)
          - If they have respiratory problem, it can affect it Rec
            becomes useless if they’ve got problems and it could rather
            remind them
      - Social context – who they are with, as they exhibit diff
        behaviours if they are going museum alone and when they are with
        someone else
      - Time location – when, where, how long they’ve got


**An example of User model/ profile**
  - **Demographic -** Name, age, nationality, education level
  - **User interest -** List of key words, list of topics
  - **User preferences -** Disabilities, preferred interaction style,
    preferred media


**Summary on user model representation (about 2 lectures)**  
  - User model can include a range of parameters:
      - Knowledge, interests, goals and tasks, background, individual
        traits, context of work
  - In class
      - Overlaying with existing / external knowledge base
      - Different ways of representing a model – taxonomy, graph, table
      - Easy to model goals but is hard to find out whereabouts the user
        is in achieving that goal
  - User model is for **ADAPTATION**\!
