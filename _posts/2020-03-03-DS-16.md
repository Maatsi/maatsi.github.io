## **16. Cloud Computing I**

**Goal** – Understand concepts of cloud computing

**Question** – when you plug your fridge or hi-fi to the wall socket, do
you actually care where the electricity comes from?
  - We don’t\!\! we encountered this in lecture 6. And the supplier
    is transparent
  - Bc we are used to this – the power grid – its complex
    but its transparent to us.
  - We have access to computing as utilities – when we need access to
    platform, service, we just go and use it\!
  - But why does this acc happen?

**Famous last words**

  - 1943 – Thomas Watson – "I think there is a world market for maybe
    five computers."
      - Chairman of IBM, That computers weren’t gonna be that popular
  - 1981 – Bill Gates – “640k RAM ought to be enough”
      - with advance of PC, IBM bought DOS, and was distributed
  - 1977- Vint Cerf – “32 bits should be enough address space for
    Internet”
      - TCP IP protocol stack
  - → We don't know what's gonna happen in 10,50 years due to technology
    advancement

**A day in the cloud: a search on Google**

  - There's no single day we don’t use google
  - We are in front of the machine, and we search for sth, and the
    keywords will end up in a google cloud, and query gets processed and
    google sends replies within 0.8 seconds
  - What made this possible??? → below headers made it possible

**Living in and Exponential World: Storage**

  - We need more and more storage as we go. And the storage density
    doubles every 12 months.
  - Google owns 20 Exabyte of data
  - Storage is there and you can store as much you need.

**Living in and Exponential World: Computer Networks**

  - Network has evolved from 1986 which is an imp year bc it was the
    production of ISDN – Integrated Services Digital Network.
  - With ISDN, you were lucky to have 64Kbs at home. But by 2000, you
    could expect up to 2.5Gbps – bandwidth increased dramatically
  - 2001-2013, network speed x4000\!\!
  - Cisco’s router
      - cisco will sell you a router and one slot would provide you 400
        GBps per second. you put them in a rack and each can provide 6.4
        terabits per second.
      - Entire system of x rack, its capable of 1 petabit per second

**Distributed Computing Paradigms**

  - This happens bc we have more
      - More computing power
      - Infinite storage
      - Very high-speed network
  - And all these three has contributed to distributed systems.
    1.  Bc distributed computing paradigm started in 1969 with the
        **internet** and it needed TCP IP protocol stack to work. →
        linking machines together
    2.  In 1989 the invention of **WWW** and http, xml, html to make it
        happen. → linking documents
    3.  Then comes with **web services** like SOAP, WSDL, and the rest
        in the 2000s → linking applications
    4.  And the imp paradigm was to link everything together in **the
        grid**

**The evolution of Distributed Computing**

  - We moved from mainframes → clusters with PCs→ grids → clouds
  - Clouds are supporting: Service Oriented Economy – we are using
    services from mobile, PC, etc
  - Cloud computing is the next step in the evolution of utility
    computing – when we need a service, we just access it on demand IT
    services
  - It requires a paradigm shift from grid computing which is a
    decentralized system whereas cloud is centralized
  - Key technological requirement for clouds - virtualisation

**“Computer Utilities” Vision: Implications of the Internet**

  - 1969 – Leonard Kleinrock, ARPANER project
      - Talking about computing utilities in 1969 where the comp was
        mainframe and internet
  - 1984 – network is the computer
  - 2008- data center is the computer

**Cloud computing – Definition**

  - We can look at 3 imp aspects
  - The fact that cloud computing refers to a large pool of virtualised
    resources that you can use and access
      - Concept of virtualisation is key in Cloud Computing
  - Resources can be dynamically allocated and reconfigured → elasticity
      - If you go to amazon and say you need 20 servers, amazon will
        give it and you can scale as you want. you use the resource that
        you need and the access is pretty easy
  - The fact that the resources are exploited by a pay-per-use model
      - More you use, more you pay. And if there's a service, you will
        need some form of Service Level Agreements

**The Cloud**
  - History roots in today’s internet apps like email, fb, dropbox, etc
    → all these live on a cloud.
  - you expect to have data center, in a centralised geographical
    location.
  - This framework would help us access the application on demand and
    support aspect of scalability and reliability
  - It’s been the invisible backend of the applications

**Cloud data centers**

  - you expect 10s to 100s of thousands of hosts, closely coupled, in
    close proximity
  - Cloud usage
      - E-business - Amazon is using them to provide computing utilities
        to the rest of the world
      - Content servers - YouTube, Netflix
      - Search engines - google
  - Challenges
      - you need to control thousands of servers but you need to think
        about applications running on the servers and users accessing
        those applications.
      - When users bring their own applications, there's a lot of
        work in terms of managing and balancing the load, processing,
        data storage and networking.

**Data Centre Infrastructure and Growth**

  - How many servers can you find in data centers?
      - Usually around 30 thousand
  - How many servers does google own?
      - 20 million
  - One thing about this is that they have challenges, and top left
    photo – you need to think carefully of where to build it and to get
    the electricity
      - Energy and environment\!\!
      - It was close to the source of water → generate hydra electricity
  - Another challenge – cooling system\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! Omg itd be
    boiling. Itself would have to consume electricity and have impact on
    the environment
  - Fb in north of Sweden coz it was cold.

**Virtualized infrastructures – Benefits**

  - In virtualisation, there is an aspect of consolidation of server
    systems.
  - In the sense that if you have a physical host server, then why not
    create a number of virtual machines that will run on your host?
      - you can take advantage of hardware and virtualise them, or create
        virtual machine that brings their own OS
  - Advantages
      - Reduced cost
      - Reduced complexity
      - Simplified administration
      - Pay per usage – to access virtualised resources

**Benefits of Cloud Computing**

  - Scalability – can scale on demand scaling of resources
  - Real time reaction to increases in demand – you can ask more and the
    reaction to ur query is automatic
  - consolidate hardware - homogeneity is not necessary bc the physical
    host can be linux and service can be windows.
  - Hardware provisioning becomes simple
  - need to think about resource transparency – effect of automation and
    fault tolerance

**Realizing the ‘Computer Utilities’ Vision – What consumers and
providers want**

  - Consumers want
      - To access the service and quality of service
      - Minimize response time and expenses
  - Cloud providers want
      - Attract customers and maximise profit
  - Single user or an enterprise accessing cloud services through an
    infrastructure and in between there's network to deliver the service

**The vision of cloud**

  - If I use a top down approach
<!-- end list -->
1.  User layer - applications - these are services that a cloud
    provider can provide. And user can bring their own service to run on
    the cloud.
    1.  In a value chain there's a user layer where services get
        consumed
2.  Service layer – where service gets provisioned.
3.  Virtualisation layer – provides virtualised execution environment.
    Virtual machines, containers run here
4.  Physical layer – The actual machines
<!-- end list -->
  - Value chain starts from service consumption and provision to the
    infrastructure provision. So it’s the hardware infrastructure to
    ensure that the services are provisioned

**A (layered) Cloud Architecture**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290220-d6d50c00-5817-11ea-844a-107d275ec656.png)
  - In DS I'm keen to have user level down to system level – is layered
  - User level – all the cloud applications on top
  - User-level middleware - Cloud programming model
      - HPC code, or virtualisation person, data processing etc
      - → Provides with environment and tools to build an application
  - Middleware – take care of management of the application
      - Pricing, monitoring, execution, accounting etc
  - System level
      - Virtualisation - VM and deployment
      - Fabric – actual hardware – physical servers and network storage
