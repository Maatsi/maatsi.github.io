## **Recommender systems (Part 1) – Knowledge-based recommenders**


**The CHIP Project - bridging the gap between virtual and physical
museum experience**
  - Rijksmuseum Amsterdam offers
      - 7000 artworks in the museum
      - 50000 artworks online
  - They have broad pool of users – schools, students, normal people
    have everything required for
     recommender system

**Vision: Personal museum guide in your pocket**

  - They decided to work together with the scientists and was looking at
    how people go through this massive
  - Need to come up with a vision when creating the project – what will
    you add to the user experience
      - Came out with the idea of **personal museum guide** – When you
        go to a museum you can have a personal guide and the guide
        creates a narrower museum
        - \- But doesn’t scale and not tailored to various types of users
      - Take the metaphor of having a personal guide and develop a
        mobile guide
  - What will a guide be? What do they do? Features of guides
      - Personal guide knows about the artworks and paintings – has the
        domain knowledge
      - Ability to identify what user might be interested with, from
        limited interactions
      - Can recommend paintings and explain based on what they know
        about the world and the user


**CHIP tools**
  - What are the personalisation features?
  - When you are in the digital space, online mostly have recommender
    systems
      - **Art recommender -** You look at one painting and it shows
        other thing to see and recommends you painting and information
          - artworks and art concepts recommendations
      - **Tour wizard -** In the virtual space, they can give you a tour
        guide – not just one painting, but shows sequels of paintings
          - managing and visualising museum tours
      - **Mobile museum guide -** As a mobile museum tour guide –
        identifies where you are in the museum
          - guiding the user inside the museum


**Knowledge Graph: Semantically Enriched Museum Data**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708763-0f870000-0c98-11eb-990f-e134cfd54c58.png)
  - Behind this recommender system – it is knowledge based.
  - First component before developing personalised app, is the
    **knowledge**
  - Snippet of the knowledge model – computer scientist together with
    curators worked together to identify the core knowledge required for
    painting rec
  - They used **concepts** – graph-based models – and concepts are
    linked with relationships and relationships are named
      - Creator has place – birthplace and deathplace
  - Have implicit relationships - Once you have the knowledge base, you
    can infer
      - Can infer style of the author, painting etc bc there's a
        connection
  - Powerful knowledge model that tells about the world but this is NOT
    the recommender. Now need to bring this to the recommender


**Discovering connections via reasoning**
  - How can you bring this external knowledge to help you to explore the
    paintings
  - Based on the metadata mapped with the external knowledge, you can
    bring other paintings bc they share some similarities with the same
    metadata
      - Having the knowledge model allows you to bring the content to
        filter what the most relevant is to the painting
  - Eg
      - Painting has relation to other 2 painters (teacher, student etc)
      - Painting showing portrait, military scenes etc
      - Exploring all different aspects by looking at one painting, due
        to the relationships
      - Not personalised, but it enriches the space
  - Can talk about much smaller pool to recommend to the user. Still
    need to evaluate what's relevant to the user user model comes in.
  - Then you need to think about mapping the content and the user model


**User profile building**
  - Problem with cold start – need to know about the user and map the
    user to the content
  - How are you going to create the user profile?
      - Can look at the browsing history of the user and rate the things
      - Sometimes we ask **explicitly** to rate the paintings.
      - The paintings shown to the users are not just random paintings; it is selected in a way that different area of the knowledge graph is being identified
  - Gives user model and we think you’d be interested in these topics –
    all that is the top categories under the knowledge model
      - End up with showing the user a list of keywords that they are
        interested in
      - It can tell me **why**\! Based on which rating and why has it
        inferred that I might be interested in x
  - Cold start is solved by **explicit rating** ‼
  - Use model now has = graph of user interests + graphs with painting
    information - overlap


**Art recommender**

  - They are looking at similarity metrics
  - They have to decide if this painting is going to interest the user –
    how similar this is to user parameter
      - How you map user model to the painting model for each of the
        painting
  - And based on that it decides how its going to recommend – it shows the
    **relevance** of the painting
      - All the descriptions of the painting and some weight, to what
        extent it is related to the user (which user already approved)
      - You can map directly the user characteristics; but you can look
        further - How much you are propagating with thin the graph,
        given the concept about the painting within the graph
  - Also recommends other artwork that is related to the PAININTG not
    the user – gives diversity but still has relevance


**Artwork description**
  - Once you have the knowledge, can automatically generate description
    of the painting with the metadata
  - Then decide within the description, what to show as important and
    what to suppress another level of personalisation ‼
      - Knowledge model allows to do that as it identifies parameters
        and it amplifies the important info more
  - Knowledge allows:
      - To describe **why** something has been recommended
      - Allows you to diversify and to recommends other paintings
      - Allow you to automatically generate description that is tailored
        to the user (CBF won't allow this)


**Summary: Knowledge based filtering**
  - Need to get a good knowledge graph to implement the recommender
  - They build on content-based filtering – user profile and information
    about the content
  - But to bring in the **knowledge model of the world**
  - Content, user AND knowledge – powerful
  - Main advantage - reasoning\!\!
      - You can infer things – and user tend to trust the recommendations that way
      - Can diversify user's experience
  - Main limitation
      - We still have the cold start problem
      - Need to prepare the content and mapping
  - Without the knowledge, can't do the recommender\! Time to get some
    knowledge and map it to the model
