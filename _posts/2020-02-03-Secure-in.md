## **2. Threat modelling**


**Threat Modelling Goals**
  - To be able to understand the system’s **threat profile –** and really break
    down the risks
  - Facilitate secure design and implementation by
    <span class="underline">addressing</span> as many threats you could
    identify and the <span class="underline">mitigation strategy</span>
    accordingly
  - To understand where we need to look for **vulnerabilities**


**Three different perspectives**: Assets, Attackers, Software (of the
system itself)
  - one most important is focusing on the system. Rest is less technical

**1. Assets**: valuable things you tryna protect
  - Some are obvious, some aren’t
      - Confidential data
      - User credentials – data breach\! And the most common
  - Gotta think wider – **intangible**, you can’t touch it\!
      - Systems availability – attacked in DoS
      - Reputation or a soft target – affect ur finances if they see you
        not running a secure system
  - Attackers want overlapping but not identical sets of things

**2. Attacker lists-** idea of this technique is that you are tryna make
a list of ppl who could attack you less technical
  - If you could help him picture what hackers would be like – could be
    more tangible
      - U may cancel out certain types of attackers
  - Might understand the motivation or skills better
      - BUT the modeller could be unconsciously biased\!
  - Example of an attacker list \[2 pdf 7\]
      - Classified into 4 diff levels of hackers (kiddy \~\~ specialist)
        && their goals (curiosity \~\~ national interests) and made a
        chart out of it

**3. Thinking about threats** IN the actual software
  - Unstructured
      - Is to think about the ranges of techniques we could use by
        <span class="underline">brainstorming</span> -it won’t give you
        all the possibilities
  - So instead, Moderately structured
      - <span class="underline">User case story</span> and analyse the
        situation more thoroughly
      - Use a <span class="underline">game approach</span> to estimate
        as a group what the threats are and how serious they are
          - Protection poker – give each risk a scale from 0 -100 (10
            units)
  - Highly structured
      - data flow diagrams, STRIDE, Attack tress

**Data Flow Diagram**
  - Dataflow – communication btwn diff elements in the system (btwn
    processes, btwn protocols)
  - !![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74365109-53ea9500-4dc5-11ea-8b12-a034d86e7f45.png)
  - Example seen in page 09 – they all interact with the system, but
    there are boundaries

  - **Trust boundaries** are shown in dash line – shows the level of
    **privilege** it requires (btwn diff. users, physical computers,
    VMs, network segments) privilege spectrum
      - Authentication – and you need a privilege to acquire
        authentication from user/ admin
      - **Principal** – any active entity with access privileges that
        are distinct
          - Least privilege – end user
          - Most privilege – systems admin
      - And every time a principal talks to another gotta draw a trust
        boundary

</br>

  - **Entry & Exit points**
      - Place where control or data crosses a trust boundary
          - E.g. Config files and registry – is the entry point when
            this is attacked the whole application could be affected\!
      - Entry points can be layered – URL shows the multiple entry
          - https – server listing you enter the web
          - login.jsp - request going into that login code another level
            entry
          - cmd=NewUser - specific operation being triggered another
            level

<!-- end list -->

  - **Why do Trust Boundaries?**
      - We tryna figure out all sets of possibilities of how attack
        could take place shows **attack surface**
      - They tend to cluster in entry and exit point in the trust
        boundary
      - So by doing this (trust boundaries), we are mapping out **where
        we are looking at\!** the value of it
          - But also gotta look at what the ACTUAL threats are

**STRIDE**
  - **Spoofing identity** - pretending to be someone that you are not
  - **Tampering with data** – modifying something in memory/ On disk/ on
    a network
  - **Repudiation** - being able to deny that you did something (when
    you did it)
  - **Information disclosure** – providing info to someone not
    authorised to see it
  - **Denial of service** – absorbing a server’s resources to prevent
    others from accessing it
  - **Elevation of privilege** – acquiring permission to do something
    that you are not authorised to do
      - User and sys admins – about moving up that spectrum of
        permission

<!-- end list -->

  - **Benefits of stride**
      - DFD – we can think what could happen in each stage of the flow
        as a checklist
          - Is there an opportunity of spoofing, privilege in this
            stage? – more <span class="underline">systematic</span>
            compared to just guessing
      - Could <span class="underline">prioritize</span> – some are more
        important – elevation of privilege is usually the most imp
          - But the priority depends on the context


  - **Stride per element** - you could focus more on individual elements
    – different types of threats could be more relevant
      - Lets say we have external entity (as DFD element type) – most
        relevant are spoofing and repudiation.
      - For each element of DFD – **assign at least one threat**
        systematic

**Other models – simple**
  - IIMF – interception, interruption, modification, fabrication
  - CIA – (violation of) confidentiality, integrity, availability

**Attack trees**
  - How we explore the details of threats could be done by identifying
    paths
  - <span class="underline">Root node</span>: overall threat, and you
    decompose that in a hierarchical component
  - <span class="underline">Child nodes</span>: represent a
    **condition** that must be true
      - Top level condition for attack to be successful keep going down
        till you cant decompose
  - shows a detailed picture of the probability of the attack being
    successful based on the percentage
  - **Attack path**: leaf node to the root – could mark up (dash line-
    less likely etc )
  - In attack trees, bear in mind that\! OR unless specified as AND
      - OR - Either of them could be the reason of attack, gotta explore
        all
      - And – shown by linking 2 nodes, and BOTH needs to fulfil to
        happen
  - Example of an attack tree \[2 pdf 18\]
      - Acquires valid username AND a valid password –
          - Could be trying random usernames and brute force attack for
            pw
              - And decompose down
      - When we are breaking it down, and its AND, eliminate one with
        less child leaf as this will cut down the workload
      - each nodes are **conditions**\! So it does NOT imply any
        situations

**Textual representation**
  - Harder to use, but could be machine readable (xml, json to build it
    graphically further)

**Risk Assessment: DREAD**  
**: D** amage potential  
**: R** eproducibility (how often an attempt at exploiting a
vulnerability actually works)  
**: E** xploitability (effort required to exploit vulnerability)  
**: A** ffected users (proportion of install base that would be affected
if an exploit became widely available)  
**: D** iscoverability (likelihood that a vulnerability will be found by
external security researchers or black hats)  
  - To explore the potential aftermath of risk – so use DREAD
  - However, could be very subjective and not all of those dimensions
    are useful in diff. contexts

**CVSS** – vulnerability scoring system – more rigorous approach
  - More thorough and objective way of scoring the vulnerability
      - attack vector, attack complexity, etc
  - Online calculator to find out

**Mitigation**
  - We can drop DFD, STRIDE to figure out the threats, but we also need
    to know how to stop it from happening\!
  - Every threat we find should be mitigated by a
    <span class="underline">security feature</span> to cut down on
    overall sec. threat
  - Identify the most high risk threat and prioritize\!
: could use attack trees to build a mitigation strategy
  - What are the attack paths and how do we mitigate it effectively?
<!-- end list -->
  - We gotta count all attack paths – and how do we eliminate as many as
    possible?
      - When its an AND tree, we can lose the entire left had side\!\!\!
        omg so efficient
