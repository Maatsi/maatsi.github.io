## **General Schema of User Adaptive Systems**

**Schema of user-Adaptive Systems**

1.  **Information collection -** When we start to design UAS, we need to
    think what info system will have about the user (**available info
    about the user**)

2.  **User model acquisition -** Using this information, how can u
    process that information (metrics, and needa analyse them)
    1.  First key – **relevance** of the information with the situation
    2.  Second key – **representation of the data** – is it enough
        information to determine the world? And we need to realize that
        we are not seeing the whole world
    3.  Third – **reliability** – is this really capturing what the user
        is saying
    4.  E.g.
        - Is the feedback relevant to the patient and was it enough to
            represent the situation and the real world. Doctor talks for
            30 mins but only writes one sentence. Not good
            representation

3.  **User model -** After processing of the data you come up with a
    **user model**
      - Could be db, XML, knowledge model
      - Is important to represent characteristics you can use for ur application
      - It ties it all together and give meaning and **structure** to
        the data we collected


4.  **User model application** – thinking of ways to interfere with the
    user, given the user model
      - Can use clustering, classification, simple analysis etc


5.  **Adapting to user -** Finally user sees the **interface**
      - Could be that it is larger, colour is different, you get more
        description about an item

  - Need to have confidence in the model and information


**Main definitions**
  - **User model** – **data structure** that contains explicit
    assumptions on all aspects of User that are relevant to the adaptive
    behaviour of the system
  - **User model acquisition –** procedure that incrementally constructs
    the user model and its functions to:
      - Store, update and delete entries in the user model;
      - Maintain user model **consistency** - How we update the user
        model etc
      - Need to ensure the user model **validity** – it is deriving from
        the model hence it needs to be valid
  - **User model application –** uses the user model to:
      - Make predictions and based on that you make decisions about User

**Discussion –** what is the most important?
  - **Information about the user** – gotta have the right information to
    start with, as everything is dependent on it
  - **User model acquisition** – bc you gotta collect and pick the right
    data
  - **Adapting to user** (interface)– when working with end users, this
    is what users see– HCI
  - **User model application** –
  - **User model** – user model gives meaning to the information by
    giving it a structure
  - By choosing what's the most important they compute differently – HCI or
    data processing or etc
  - Need to have confidence in the user model

**Examples – Jameson’s paper**

  - Summarized into 2 forms to adapting

  - **Supporting system use** – helps the user to use the system so they    continue using it
      - Can take over parts of routine tasks
      - \*Adapt interface – smart menu
      - Helping w system use – simple guidance
      - Mediating interaction w the real world
      - Controlling dialogue


  - **Supporting information acquisition**
      - help them find info
      - recommend products
      - tailor information presentation
      - support collaboration
      - \*support learning – SQL tutor


**Adapting the interface - Smart menus**

  - We need to think about what info we have about user, diff views of
    the menu as user goes thru them
  - **General schema of smart menus**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707718-47407880-0c95-11eb-9b1f-2a594a76eac2.png)

    1.  Collects info about menus that user clicks – this is the input
        of the algorithm (or how long user stays, what files etc)
    2.  Model aquisition – register the menus that user select
    3.  User model – need some way to process and come up w
        identification of if it is a frequently used actions
          - Frequency, recency
    4.  Reason about user’s option choices ?
    5.  Modified menu content – showing the smart options

**Supporting learning - SQL tutor**
  - Learning system - We have a digital info to read, a quiz, analyse
    then you decide if you are progressing
      - How confident they are with diff SQL commands – SELECT, ORDER BY


  - **General schema of SQL tutor**
    1.  User writes SQL queries
    2.  Application of **constraints** on Users solution – then it ticks
        how many constraints have been ticked. They write rules for each
        problem (constraints) to score it
    3.  Subset of constraints mastered/ missed by user - if the user is
        not good at SELECT, pull out more related problems. It decides
        what problem subset is appropriate for the user
    4.  Rule-based engine consulting the user model – how to generate
        the feedback and how to make a coherent piece
          - How constantly did you give a feedback?
          - And as they become better u’ll fade and give less feedback
    5.  Complexity and feedback – gives user feedback
