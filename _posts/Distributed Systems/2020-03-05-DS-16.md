## A Layered Cloud Architecture

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290220-d6d50c00-5817-11ea-844a-107d275ec656.png)
  - **Application** - The cloud application running on a cloud –
    social computing, enterprise, scientific
  - This app is implemented thanks to **cloud programming module** – it
    is there and it provides environments and tools to build the
    application
      - HPC - MPI
      - Data analysis – programming models such as Hadoop or map reduce.
  - Once ive got a programming model – we go to **middleware**
      - Bringing a large number of resources to the user and dealing
        with one single coherent model
      - Μy app needs to be executed hence there will be execution
        management, monitoring and etc
  - you expect the app to run and have some sort of service attached to it
  - **Virtualisation** layer – very important layer 개강조 ㅋ – cloud data
    centers use and rely heavily on virtualisation - hence host to host
    - number of virtual machines
      - The layer would keep an eye on virtual machines that are running
        on the physical server – need an engine that know what engines
        are running here and there. → management is part of the layer
  - Steps of how to deploy an application using an architecture like
    this one


## Taxonomy of Cloud Models

  - Nowadays we look at how services are exposed in the cloud – google,
    IBM, etc- you could distinguish 3 basic models
  - \[17 pdf 5\]
  - Layer 1 – Software as a Service
      - On the cloud, there's a software out there and through interface
        you can access it. So it’s very much like running a software
        packet remotely. E.g. google apps
  - Layer 2 – Platform as a Service
      - Interesting bc it is possible to bring ur own application and
        deploy it on the cloud – therefore you need a platform to
        facilitate the deployment.
          - MS azure – to help you provide the platform that you need
  - Layer 3 – Infrastructure as a Service
      - you have access to infrastructure – aka access to servers which is
        dynamically managed and have access to service as a root user.
        And can run own business on Infra as service
      - Resource that you access is likely to be virtualized and you pay
        as you use
          - E.g. EC2 – amazon. Virtualised resource manager
  - \* as service
      - Star could be anything – storage, network, db, hardware, etc


## Cloud Architecture

- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290412-2adff080-5818-11ea-8dca-5a2e8670cdbd.png)

1.  Hypervisor
      - Two datacentres site A and B, and with these two sides Id like
        to have virtual machines running on these physical servers –
        virtualization is key and you can run number of VMs in one
        single server
      - To do that, you rely on this hypervisor which
        <span class="underline">creates instances of virtual machines on
        a physical host</span>.
      - Hence maximizing the effective use of computing resources → key
        in this virtualisation layer


2.  Virtual infrastructure manager
      - Once uve created VMs, you realize you have thousands of VM
        running on thousands of servers.
      - Therefore you need <span class="underline">management of
        VMs</span> – virtual infrastructure manager.


3.  Virtual machine cluster
      - Its going up towards the application, and you can group some
        VMs together so that they could run on a cluster – hence you are
        moving towards a <span class="underline">platform as a
        service</span>


4.  Distributed application
      - Application but could run on one or number of VMs
  - Emphasis on role of hypervisor and role of VIM and potentially
    grouping these VMs as clusters


**System level: Architecture of a Server Cluster**

  - Layers of the cloud architectures
  - Bottom up approach – hardware to application
  - Cloud datacentres tend to rely on racks of servers – it comes into a
    final number of 48 to 64 servers in a rack
  - If you have a cluster of servers in one rack, you end up with server
    racks.
  - Server racks – every rack can talk to the rack next to it, through a    cluster of switch with very high bandwidth.
      - 10 gigabit/ sec in a server rack
      - Expect internet to do an important job – still LAN\!
  - These having a rack and number of racks will allow you to have 100s
    of racks in one place – what's interesting is google amazon etc,
    they don’t buy one server at once. They buy a container of racks\!\!
      - Buy the container of racks and scalability is key and is IMP

**Virtual Machine Managers**
  - Which hypervisor do we use to partition the server?
      - VMware
      - ESXi – commercial VMM manager which provides full
      - Xen – amazon has been using it but now they use KVM
  - → they are hypervisors and support virtualisation as you want it


## Virtual Infrastructure Manager

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290482-52cf5400-5818-11ea-8822-0ce9650cf63d.png)
  - VIM – very very imp coz it’s a brain that decides where to
    instantiate the VM
      - Where does it go?? Which server would the VM be allocated →
        scheduling question
      - Q: VIM algorithms – where do you allocate VM on which server???
          - A - Load balancing and the number of virtual machines in the
            hypervisor
          - Energy aware scheduling algorithms – ensuring that the
            energy consumption is minimum
          - Network aware scheduling – a problem we will always be
            facing is :
              - Always to do with app and data that ur app will use. In
                DS, the data can be quite large (like vid) – if its
                likely to process large → then should I move the app or
                data closer?
              - Transfer the computing to data – so it always will think
                to move application to move closer to data
      - Can provision new cluster node - need IP and MAC address.
      - Provide uniform view of the resource pool
      - Life cycle management and monitoring of VM – can migrate VM from
        this server to another depending on the network
      - The VIM integrates image, network and virtualisation.

**Virtual Infrastructure Manager – Open Nebula**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290509-61b60680-5818-11ea-9eb1-30a52c7c7afa.png)
  - Interesting architecture – its layered and it looks at tools, core
    and drivers
  - In Core - It doesn’t care which hypervisor you wanna work with – you
    will have the management of VMs through VIM, management of server
    through host manager, and network through virtual network manager
  - Request manager is through XML-RPC – communication of processors
    through XML
  - Flexible design as you can add modules.
  - One of the succession of European money funding. Reservoir – it
    reached a large user base and more development
  - VN manage- virtual network

**Virtual Infrastructure Manager – Openstack**

  - The Linux of cloud computing in 2010 – NASA and Rackspace were 2 big
    players
  - If they need cloud infrastructure you can download and to run a
    cloud → ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform
  - Management layer that adds automation and control of servers
  - 7 core projects – projects don’t use XML-RPC, but they use queue
    \!\! – communication lecture \[4 pdf 23\] –activeMQ
  - In federation system, you have actors and they trust each other and
    work together. If you have a cloud1 cloud 2, why can't you build a
    federation cloud of heterogenous public/ private clouds for better
    resource allocation and dispersion of resources

## Virtual Machines versus Containers
  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 47 34 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290528-70042280-5818-11ea-9d9b-dfe41aa05f48.png)
  - He has mentioned VM – there's more than that. If we use a VM, it may
    bring a guest operating system. The host OS can be Linux but you
    could create 3 VM with each own OS.
  - Recently, there's been a concept of containers – you don’t need
    guest OS
      - you rely on core OS and create instances of applications
      - They run in completely isolated env
      - Containers are light weight\!\! And don’t rely host OS → Offers
        greater efficiency and performance

**The case of containers**

  - Concept of microservices – inside the container is a single
    executable microservice, which provides a simple function from a
    exe. Applications are made up of microservices
  - These microservices can run in many containers → need to be linked
    with message queuing or load balancing
  - Since microservices run on container, so you need a container
    engine.
  - Eg
      - Docker
      - Singularity
      - Robust application that needs fault tolerance. To ensure the
        container is restarted on time
  - Uni makes use of extensive containers and prefers singularity


## Cloud service life cycle

  - How we bring the construction of an application from constructing
    it to deploying and to run it.
  - Steps to do that\!

<!-- end list -->
1.  Cloud application
2.  Programming model/service construction
    - **Programming model** – to enable the development of an app.
        could be MPI, Hadoop
    - **Application packager -** need to create service manifest.
        so that you explicitly say that these are the resources that my
        app needs, but if they change, no need to recompile.
    - **VM image constructor** – generates images - can be google or
        domain and is a key characteristic of VM
3.  Service deployment
    - **Application manager** – to deploy service on a cloud
        infrastructure. Know where it runs
    - **VM Contextualizer** – contextualisation means automatically
        generate dependencies of applications. E.g. libraries need to
        be found on the fly. Dependencies need to be embedded on the VM
        image
    - **Application monitor** – to monitor the service at operation
        time
4.  Service operation
    - **VM manager** - Need to manage and allocate VMs to physical
        nodes
    - **VM infrastructure manager** to manage VM – open nebula and
        openstack

    - **Infrastructure monitor** – to monitor resources

## Private, public and hybrid clouds

  - Public cloud – the cloud provider. E.g. MS azure, aws, etc. you can
    just go and use the resources you need
  - Hybrid cloud – when you have own resources, intranet, and private
    cloud. But then you might not have everything, and you reach out and
    combine resources
      - Multiple clouds working together, including public and private
        clouds
      - Can be delivered by a federated cloud provider that combines its
        own resources with those of other providers
      - Broker can also deliver a hybrid cloud
  - Private cloud – private internal network to selected users only.
    More private and secure

**Use Cases**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75290554-7d211180-5818-11ea-945d-ce24b0747466.png)
  - End user to Cloud
      - Applications running on the cloud and accessed by end users
  - Enterprise to cloud
      - An enterprise is using the cloud for its internal processes such
        as for db and storage services
  - Enterprise to cloud to end-user
      - An enterprise is using the cloud to deliver data and services to
        the end user
  - Enterprise to cloud to enterprise
      - Two enterprises use the same cloud.
      - The focus here is the hosing resources in the clouds so that
        apps from diff businesses can interoperate
      - E.g. a supply chain
      - → look image.
