## Google Cloud gets more expensive

- **Industry:** Cloud storage
- **Who:** Google Cloud
- **What:** [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/updates-to-google-clouds-infrastructure-pricing) announced significant price increases across a number of core services, effective from October 1, 2022.
- **When:** Announced March 14th, 2022 but effective from  October 1, 2022.
- **Why:** Google announced saying that the price increase is to provide “more flexible pricing models and options”
- **How:**
  - Number of core storage features like **multi-region Nearline storage**, will see increases of 50%.
  - Google Cloud’s **Coldline Storage Class A** will double from $0.10 per 10,000 operations to $0.20.
  - **Cloud Load Balancing** too, will see a price increase now that Google applies an “outbound data processing charge” of $0.008 to $0.012
- **So?:**
  - Google is aware of the effect it will have on customers, but they noted that customers should 'adapt their current usage to better align their applications to these new business models.'
  - Most developers are not amused by this increase.
- **Comment**:In the era where infrastructure companies are fighting for a cheaper, better and more flexible storage services, I thought it was interesting that Google is taking this shift. Got me thinking, would it still be competitive against AWS? Azure? Cloudfare? etc. From someone who works at an infrastructure company it was interesting to see how the cloud market is also changing its pricing model/ business development strategy, etc.
