## **4. Message Oriented Communication**

We looked at the architectural style, and today we are looking at the
communication side of the things – all sorts of ways and mechanism to
implement communication in dist sys

**Goal**

  - HOW the communication takes place in DS - Interprocess communication
    is at the heart of all ds
  - It is important to examine the ways that processes on different
    machines can exchange information
      - But def of DS emphasizes on message passing is highlighted
  - Communication in ds is always based on low level message passing as
    offered by the underlying network
  - Some widely used models for communication
      - Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
      - Remote Method Invocation
      - Message Oriented communication

**Layered Protocols**

  - ![page4image21783280](media/image14.png)
  - Due to the absence of shared memory, all communication in DS is
    <span class="underline">based on sending and receiving low level
    messages.</span>
  - There are number of rules that communicating processes must adhere
    to - **protocols** and structuring these protocols in the form of
    layers.
  - Each layer provides an **interface** to the layer above it.
  - This model, OSI model, there are 7 layers that communicate w each
    other. In theory the application layer on the sending side will
    communicate with the receiving side, going through all the layers in
    btwn.
  - **OSI – Open System Interconnection** – we don’t use this model; we
    use simplified version with 5 layers
      - In TCP/IP, 보드 scrapping out session & physical layers
  - Importance of \!\!**Layer,** **interfaces** and **protocols**

**Layered Protocols II**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-17 at 10 52 27 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74690747-2f812500-51d8-11ea-8290-6cb38590f6d8.png)

<!-- end list -->

  - Each layer will add a **header** to the front of the message and
    passes the resulting message. – including usage and
    source/destination addresses.
      - Use of <span class="underline">overhead</span> – since it will
        use network resources. It’s a price to pay to add a header
      - Some will add a <span class="underline">trailer</span> too –
        data link layer does.
  - End up with a message with 6 different headers. This is how the
    messages are gonna be converted into bits by sending it to the
    physical layer which is then transported to link.
  - When it hits the bottom, physical layer transmits the message by
    putting git to a medium.
  - When it gets to the receiving side, each header will **strip off**
    **the header** and examine it. → you obtain original
  - →v imp that the original msg is passed back\!\!\!

**Middleware Protocols**

  - Sits btwn the application and OS (in fact a transport layer).we
    need some form of layer that will provide us with a single coherent
    view
  - It provides **common** **services** and **communication**
    **protocols** that can be used by many **different** applications
  - However, there will be issues:
      - **Marshalling of data** – if we are sending the data through
        network, we have to marshall and unmarshall. U’ll need to build
        a msg and tell them what ur gonna do with this msg
          - Marshalling and unmarshalling itself is an overhead because
            the data is serialized into 1s and 0s, and when marshalling,
            it has to compose the msgs
      - **Naming protocols** – in middleware, you are accessing
        resources all over the place. So you need some sort of protocol
        to name those processes
      - **Security** – Paramount. A secure communication in DS is
        essential -need security protocols
      - **Scaling mechanisms** - some sort of service with replication
        and caching – middleware should deal with this
        transparently\!\!very imp in terms of scaling
          - Since it replicates and caches, it takes up a lot of data

**Middleware: Adapted layering Scheme**

  - ![Picture 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74690879-796a0b00-51d8-11ea-88d3-6cf67d5d40f5.png)
  - Very easy to take this scheme and map it in a network architecture-
    TCP IP
  - We communicate one to one, and the LHS will have to communicate with
    RHS- it has to go through all this layer
  - \!\!\! imp role is that <span class="underline">Network layer has to
    ensure that this communication takes plac</span>e\!\!\!

**Types of Communications**

  - ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74690888-7ff88280-51d8-11ea-89fb-85efa8ed8323.png)
  - If we take client server model and we take an email system. how does
    it acc work in terms of client server? → core is the middleware
    communication service.
      - Client sends a request, server deals with it, server will reply
      - What’s interesting is, in email system, email needs to be stored
        in the server before sending

<!-- end list -->

1.  First need to **synchronize** – server and client.
2.  Client sends the msg to the <span class="underline">mail delivery
    system</span>
    1.  Once the msg gets through the server, the message is stored in a
        storage facility.
3.  Server connects to the mail delivery system and does the rq -
    deliver the message
4.  Notify the client that its done - **another synchronization**

<!-- end list -->

  - <span class="underline">Constant communication</span> is always
    there

**Types of Communications II**

  - **Asynchronous** and **synchronous**
      - **Synchronous** – if you have client and server, they both need
        to be running, and they communicate in a way that the other side
        is listening.
      - **Asynchronous** – client can send a msg and can do sth else.
        The message is temporarily stored.


  - **Transient** and **persistent**
      - **Transient** – is only stored as long as the
        <span class="underline">sending and receiving application are
        both\!\! executing</span>.
          - If the app on the other side is unavailable and when you
            can't communicate, it discards the message → does not ensure
            the message sending
          - All transport layer typically provides this.
      - **Persistent** – message that has been submitted for
        transmission is <span class="underline">stored by the
        communication middleware as long as it takes to deliver the
        message</span>

          - So not necessary of sending app to continue application

  - U can take transient and make it synchronous, or take persistent and
    make it asynchronous \!

**Types of Communications III**

  - In this case, **client/ server** is usually **transient synchronous
    communication** where the server and client
    <span class="underline">has to be active at the time of
    communication</span>
      - Client sends a rq, Server waits for the incoming rq
      - Client issues rq and blocks until it receives reply
      - **drawback**
          - They have to be active at the time\! → They can't do other
            work

  - **Msg oriented middleware** aims for higher level **persistent
    asynchronous communication**\!\! - best of both worlds

      - Processes queued message
      - Persistent means that the copy will always be stored\!\! And
        won't be lost → ensures fault tolerance
      - Sender does not have to wait to reply.
  - How you can find it in the real world – whether that is first or
    second


**Remote Procedure Call (RPC) –** in the real world, this communication
is implemented as RPC

  - Is at the heart of DS communication - \!\!\! very imp mechanism
  - Sending and receiving msgs – the process isn’t concealed.
  - <span class="underline">To locally call a procedure that is
    effectively implemented on a **remote** **machine**</span>
      - Process on machine A calls a procedure on machine B, the calling
        process on A is suspended, and execution of the called.
        Procedure takes place on B.

  - Problem
      - Since the calling and called procedures run on diff machine,
        they execute in diff address space.
      - Parameters and results have to be passed → complicated in diff
        machines
      - Either or both machines can crash and failure can happen


**RPC operation**

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691078-4a07ce00-51d9-11ea-9ede-5c072ca7e6b1.png)

1.  Client is gonna <span class="underline">invoke a procedure</span> in
    client stub.
    1.  With 2 parameter a and b – 2 diff data types
2.  The client stub <span class="underline">builds a message</span>, and
    calls local OS
3.  Client OS takes the msg and <span class="underline">send it to the
    remote (Server) OS</span>
4.  Server OS <span class="underline">place</span> the msg to the
    <span class="underline">server stub</span>
5.  Server stub <span class="underline">unpacks parameters</span>, calls
    server
6.  Server understands what to do, do it and returns result to stub
7.  Server stub <span class="underline">builds a message</span> and
    calls local OS
8.  Server’s OS <span class="underline">sends the msg</span> to the
    client OS
9.  Client OS gives msg to <span class="underline">client stub</span>
10. Client stub unpacks the msg, and return it to the client
In a concept of architecture – we have object-based style marshalling.
We put RPC in object based – we end up with RMI – **Remote** **Method
Invocation,** they are really the same

**RPC: Parameter Passing**

  - Although its very nice, when it comes to implementation, there are
    number of problems to deal with
      - Need to understand <span class="underline">how marshalling and
        unmarshalling works</span>
      - Client and the server machines might have
        <span class="underline">diff data representation</span> – 2 diff
        architecture, data encoding could be diff. so how do we make
        them talk?
      - <span class="underline">Wrapping paramete</span>**r** – do you
        start with last or first byte when marshalling and
        unmarshalling?
      - <span class="underline">Same encoding</span> – server and client
        has to agree on same encoding
      - <span class="underline">Basic data values</span> (float, int)
        can be represented differently
      - Marshalling and unmarshalling <span class="underline">complex
        data value</span> (arrays, unions), how do you do it?
  - In order for RPC to work, client and server need to correctly
    understand the msgs, and hopefully, will be able to transform them
    into **machine dependent representation**

**  
Data Marshalling Issues**

  - Diff encoding for charterers
      - IBM uses <span class="underline">EBCDIC</span> - Extended Binary
        Coded Decimal Interchange Code,
      - <span class="underline">Ascii</span> – American standard for
        code information interchange
  - When it comes to implementing integers and floats, what kinda
    encoding?

      - **Little endian** – start with least representative
          - 44,33,22,11
      - **Big endian** - start with the most representative
          - Send 11, 22, 33, 44
      - Usually big endian is used to transfer bytes
  - They need to agree on the format\!\!


**Interaction using Asynchronous RPC**
  - ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691102-6277e880-51d9-11ea-98fc-fdcd556d07dd.png)
  - Different from the traditional RPC, in asynchronous RPC, client can
    continue without waiting for an answer from the server\!\!
  - Calls request → waits for acceptance, and continue doing other thing
    → when results are available, server sends a
    <span class="underline">callback to client</span>
  - But the problem is, reliability is not guaranteed and we dunno if
    its gonna be processed.
  - Client and server does not need to
    synchronize constantly, and that you can do sth else

**Message Oriented Communication: Transient Messaging with sockets**

  - So with sockets, you have server listening to it, client connects to
    server and communication takes place. Once the comm is done, they
    both close it
  - Complicated coz you gotta know the port and shit but it served us
    well

**The Message Passing Interface (MPI) : Advanced Transient Messaging**

  - We have 2 models -shared memory and private memory models → they
    communicate through msg passing
  - <span class="underline">Supports transient communication.</span>
  - Parallel computers have interconnection networks. But historically,
    the HPC were shipped with proprietary communication libraries
      - Problematic coz the software might not be compatible with diff
        machines (btwn HPCs)

  - Sooo **MPI** was designed for parallel computations
      - Assumes communication takes place within a known group of
        processes
          - Each group and process is assigned an identifier.
      - Makes direct use of underlying network

**The Message Passing Interface (MPI)**

  - Large number 150 primitives available
      - 6 ways of sending messages – MPI\_bsend, send, ssend, sendrecv,
        etc
  - V imp for HPC community to easily write highly efficient apps

**Message Oriented Persistent Communication: Message-Queuing Model**

  - New way of thinking and designing MPI – queuing
  - Provides support for **Asynchronous persistent** – and middleware
    does this by implementing a queue, and neither sender nor receiver
    has to be active
  - <span class="underline">Queues</span> correspond to
    <span class="underline">buffers</span> – it goes to the queue, and
    you fetch the messages
      - Put – append
      - Get – get the msg from the queue
      - Poll – check if the msg is in the queue
      - Notify – handler – as a sever, if I'm interested in event that
        hasn’t arrived in the queue, if it arrives notify me\!

  - ![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691106-6572d900-51d9-11ea-9082-53a3f06eac39.png)

<!-- end list -->
1)  Both sender and receiver is active
2)  Sender is active but receiver is not active – msg can't be delivered
    1.  append msg in the queue and get it once they are active
3)  Send the message and went to do sth else, receiver is active –
    receiver can read msg that was sent, but not necessary that the
    sender is executing
4)  Both sender and receiver are inactive
They are <span class="underline">loosely coupled</span> – no need for
them to be <span class="underline">synchronized as everything goes
through a queue\!\!</span>

**General Architecture of a Message-Queuing System**

  - ![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691107-660b6f80-51d9-11ea-8560-c3309f75b72f.png)
  - If we take this queue-level addressing and link it to the network-
    level addressing, its so similar
  - We communicate through queue, and client need to know how the
    destination queue is addressed. So we need to know the
    <span class="underline">name of the queue</span> and the
    <span class="underline">address of where it can be accessed</span>.
    → **queue manager**
  - Each **name** is associated with **contact address** (host, pair)
  - U need **lookup** that makes the name-to-address be available for
    queue manger
      - Lookup says, I'm a sender, I need to append this msg, give me
        the name and the address of that queue.
      - I want to send a msg to this receiver, where is its queue → it
        then finds the address of the queue, and the msg will be routed
        to that queue

  - Is what DNS implements, in the sense that it passes the address when
    you give it a name and we have an address lookup database
  - ![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691108-673c9c80-51d9-11ea-8d59-b30ecb3c3237.png)
  - Can have **router** of queue managers**.** The request will be
    routed to an adequate queue manager, which will then find an
    appropriate queue using **lookup**
  - Main mechanism is a queue where senders and receivers post messages

**AMQP: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol**

  - There's been a standard protocol - AMQP that is extensively used in
    the real world <span class="underline">to ensure the safe
    transportation of information btwn applications</span> btwn
    organisations
      - In areas such as finance, transportation, smart grid, online
        gaming
  - In number of OS, they do have support for AMQP implementation.
  - There are cloud based offerings, i.e. amazon, you may be able to use
    cloud services, and they will potentially give you opportunity to
    use AMQP cloud base offerings
  - It’s a standard, which can be implemented in different flavours
      - Rabbit MQ
      - ActiveMQ

**Example: OpenStack Compute - Management Stack Control Built on
Queues**

  - Example of how AMQP protocol works
  - Openstack – <span class="underline">virtual infrastructure
    manager</span> extensively used in cloud computing
      - Supports the interaction btwn virtual infrastructure manager
        such as Openstack
      - Message queues are there to <span class="underline">provide
        communication and manage data persistence</span> in all the
        components in Openstack
      - Openstack has a lot of components, and
        <span class="underline">they have to interact</span>→ through a
        queue\! Using **rabbitMQ**
          - Had a default queue of mySQL DB, and can attach 1 queue to 1
            database, and potentially have up to 1000 machines in the
            cloud, interacting with each other through this queue
          - 1 queue up to 1000 machine
      - The <span class="underline">communication</span> through
        component is through <span class="underline">routing</span>, it
        gets routed to the right queue, and every time component needs
        sth, it <span class="underline">uses an API</span>, and this API
        is some form of message that displays on the queue
      - Then you have server listening to this queue, putting out
        messages from the queue, and potentially responding to request
        through the queue
  - → example in the real world where the protocol is actively used

**Summary**

  - We have discussed the rules that communication processes must adhere
    to
  - Looked at a number of widely used models for communication
      - RPC
      - Sockets
      - Message Oriented Middleware
  - Importance of message queuing systems
