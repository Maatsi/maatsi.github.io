##  Brazilian soy farmers try 5G technology with Huawei equipment
- **Who:**  Brazil's Goias and Huawei
- **What:**  The Brazilian farm state rolled out a pilot project on Thursday to increase productivity and take fast action against disease using fifth-generation technology and equipment provided by China’s Huawei Technologies Co.
- **When:**  3rd of December, 2020
- **Why:**  Because the 5G communications will allow producers to improve crops through the collection of information by sensors placed in the fields - by sensors placed in the fields, on harvesters and drones, so that it can be readily crossed with meteorological and humidity data.
- **How:**  
  - Combining fast broadband communications with real time cloud data processing will give farmers the information so they can rapidly take actions against diseases and other threats to their crops.
  - The pilot was launched in the soy-farming town of Rio Verde, and uses a 5G network built by telecom company Claro, a unit of Mexico’s América Móvil.
- **So?:**  Brazil’s government decided not to ban the use of Huawei equipment in next year’s auction of 5G frequencies spectrum; telecommunications regulator Anatel has proposed rules that do not exclude the Chinese Company.
