## **11. Command injection & input validation**


**Objectives**

  - To begin looking at software vulnerabilities by considering ways of
    injecting malicious code into applications
  - To frame these issues as **input validation problems**
  - To examine a specific case study of input validation, involving URLs

**Command injection**

  - Where untrusted data which is coming from an outside source that is
    influenceable by the attacker, crucial thing, combined with trusted
    data – typically a string format.
  - Some command could be embedded in the source code, but some comes
    from an external source.
  - Assembled string is passed on to assembler/ compiler – that will do
    sth in response to that command.
  - If you do this, it's v easy to make mistake in the sense that the
    input is always gonna be a data. And failing to recognize that you
    can craft the input in a way that it can change the meaning of the
    command that’s executed by a server.

**Simple example**

~~~~
import os
import sys

os.system("lpq -P " + sys.argv[1])
~~~~

  - A program to see what gets printed on the printer queue
  - We can do this on command line – lpq -p specifies the printer queue
  - Q: The question is how do you make this do sth else?
      - A: you need to make first command to do the right thing – then
        you make second command to do sth else. Usually close the first
        command then run the second command.
  - If he does python lpq.py ‘Staff; ls -l’ and it lists all the file
      - He could do sth malicious as well omg

**Warning signs**

  - If you see a command being constructed with **simple string
    concatenation**, there's no checking done for the untrusted string –
    then you got a danger hazard.
  - How to look out for the possibility that it could happen in the
    first place. it can only happen if those stings are used to run sth.
  - Can use diff commands to run a cod that runs a shell or subprocess
      - C/C++ : system(), popen(), execlp()
      - Python: os.system(), os.popen() etc
  - Then you need to look at how the command is constructed – is it
    using anything from untrusted source and if so, is any kind of
    checking done?
  - Need to be extra careful if the code is running with HIGH
    privileges\!\!\!- they can abs do anything on the system

**SQL injection**

  - Sin number 1 – SQL injection and to simply focus on databases
  - Instead of command being constructed from trusted/untrusted – we are
    constructing a SQL query
  - Risk – if no validation is done in the input – attackers can change
    the meaning of the query\!
  - Again, what we are looking out here is, esp in web app – when you
    are querying the database, and when query **constructed from an
    untrusted input using a simple string concatenation**
  - There's a form in the user application and the user input of the
    form is read by the application, construct a query and execute the
    query. i.e. Obama healthcare where they wanted to query via search
    box

**Exercise**

~~~~
String q = "SELECT * from user WHERE name='" + name + "'";
Statement stmt = db.createStatement();
ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery(q);
~~~~
  - Name = “joe”
      - Result: 0 or more rows return, from table user where the name
        column has name joe
  - Name – “joe’ OR 1=1 –"
      - Everything from the user table is gonna be returned
  - What you tryna do is close off what developer expected, and add sth
    new to change the name.
  - The ‘ closes off the name but then we modify the query with OR
    clause – 1=1 all of them\!

**Examples**

  - Healtcare.gov
      - When Obama was a president – he set up healthcare.gov
      - In common searches – some users were tryna do ‘; select \* from
        users’ – sneaky\!
  - Finnish patent site
      - The trade name was set to Glow Finlad; DROP TABLE users; – Oy
  - What we can see here is that it's not being checked\!\!

**Fixing it**
  - Manual filtering is an option – coz then you can make sure none of
    the bad stuff get through
  - Fix is not to catch all the bad stuff coz we won't be able to
  - Problem was to do with the way we construct the query using
    <span class="underline">concatenation</span>.
  - Easy solution – to use **prepared statements**
      - We simply leave a placeholder for the input – so no way you can
        modify\!\! E.g. name= ? is a placeholder
      - All we need to do is to set the placeholder to the variable\! -
        stmt.setString(1, name);

**A generic problem**

  - Generically what's happening is we have untrusted source, and
    there's **too much trust** in format and content, thinking that it
    won't be malicious.
  - If the untrusted data is written into memory, or if we use it to
    construct a command – bad things happen
  - We can't control the fact that the input is untrusted – coz it's
    coming from outside but what we CAN do is to check it\!\! **input
    validation**

**Handling malicious input**

  - All input needs to be validated either:
      - Validate on input
      - Validate before we first use it

**Trust boundary & choke points**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75278650-30324080-5802-11ea-86ea-f9c7703dd786.png)
  - We have a trust boundary in the application– and it's implicitly
    trusted in here.
  - We have environment variables and config data as
    <span class="underline">untrusted</span> - coz it's outside of the
    app
  - All the input goes through a choke point (blue polygon), where we do
    a checking of validity
  - We NEED to check it\!\! – coz if no checking is done, there's a
    potential of vulnerability

**Case study: URL validation**

  - Some of the things that could go wrong with URL
  - Who's responsible for the validation? User? Browser? Server?

**Example: Phishing**

  - Email that has a plausible looking link. E.g.
    web.auth.ox.ac.uk.e-du.ir
  - It has the same site – mockup of it but it fools the user using a
    diff or malicious link.
  - So you could say that it's users fault to not realize, but sth can
    be done in the browser too
  - Problem is the URL cold be less obvious

**Homograph Attacks**

  - Some pairing of the domain – original and fake
  - micrоsoft.com / microsoft.com – it looks the SAME\!\!
  - There's one extra bite – we are using Unicode that looks like o that
    requires a 16 bit, which is HARDER to tell

**2015 example**

  - Security researcher registered a website ‘IIoydsbank’ – I I not
    ll\!\!
  - It's to do with fonts\!\! – there's no visual difference between II
    and ll – hence could fool the user
  - He put a warning message and he got a TLS certificate for it.

**Use of Punycode**
  - Way of representing Unicode characters into an ascii form
  - This domain was registered as xn—e1awd7f.com
      - The xn tells browser to use Punycode
      - you could use code that decodes to sth that looks legitimate
      - So punycode translates fake e1awd7f.com into epic.com

**URL obfuscation in browsers**

  - Sneaky - URLs can have a user@location format
  - Use %00 – null byte and old browsers – null bytes terminates the
    string, and it hits it and display trusted.com, but the latter
    evil.com isn’t shown\!\!
      - But malicious one can for example have
        <http://www.trusted.com%00@www.evil.com>
      - Omg it takes you to evil.com
  - QR code same concept to fooling

**Directory Traversal**

  - Imagine my URL contains ../ which moves one directory
  - Allows the attackers to go outside the root of the web server, and
    you can path down into other file systems
      - ../or..\\
      - %2e%2e%2for%2e%2e%5c - Or sneakily to encode it
      - ..%c1%1cor..%c0%afor..%c1%9c
  - if you see a lot of ../ etc, suggestion you might be getting
    directory traversal

**Example**

  - Cookie specifies which temp file - Cookie:
    TEMPLATE=../../../../etc/passwd
  - And you crafted the cookie value – and you step out of template down
    into sys password
  - What you hope for where is you get the sys pwd file

**Canonicalization**

  - Canonical = “In its simplest or standard form”
  - **Canonicalization** = process of converting the various equivalent
    forms of a name into a single standard name
  - How do we solve these problem we make everything to a
    <span class="underline">standardized form\!</span>
  - We need to reduce URL to a standard form and get rid of character
    encoding, and then you can check for maliciousness

**Summary**

  - Explored the general idea of command injection and seen how it is
    frequently used in SQL injection attacks
  - Framed the vulnerabilities discussed in recent lectures as problems
    of **input validation**
  - Seen that phishing can bypass casual user validation of URLs (e.g.
    via a homograph attack)
  - Noted that browsers can mishandle malicious URLs, as can servers
    (e.g. a directory traversal)
