## **10. Abuse of DNS, ARP & application protocols**


**Objectives**

  - To consider how <span class="underline">supplementary
    protocols</span> dealing with name/ address resolution can be
    attacked
  - Application layer - To consider insecurities in selected protocols
    of the application layer
      - Remote logins, Email

**Address resolution**
  - **DNS** -higher level one, turning human readable **domain names**
    to IP addresses, IP address needed for routing packets. Logical
    addressing scheme of the machines.
  - **ARP** – But we need a further lower level resolution protocol
    which turns IP addresses into physical machine addresses **MAC
    addresses** that identify specific network interfaces of hardware
  - Spoofing is possible for both of these protocols – how that works
    and in case of DNS how we attempt to solve this
      - Fooling the **DNS** software to giving attacker certain address
        instead of the legit one for a given domain name
      - **ARP** – spoofing arp layer into giving attacker a selected
        fake MAC address for a given IP address.

**Attacking DNS**
  - **Cache poisoning** – direct attack
      - E.g. is the google domain of DRC Congo in December 2011, and
        cache poisoning affected that resolution process. It'd be
        redirected to this page.
  - Hijacking site’s DNS records via the registrar for that domain name
    - indirect way
      - E.g. Brazilian bank – criminal online banking sending email for
        5 hours – because the attacker targeted DNS record for that
        bank. During that attack, the visitors going to what they
        thought it was the bank, was redirected to a fake one and it
        harvested credentials of people and installed malware
      - Three state against attack against domain name registrar that
        has been attacked.

**DNS Cache poisoning**
  - The idea is that you wanna be the first one to respond to a DNS
    query – rather than the real response, you wanna get in there.
  - But its challenging coz there's a <span class="underline">16-bit
    transaction ID</span>. Bc it is a random number; you only have small
    chance of getting that correct. And then you have to wait coz if you
    guess the ID wrong you are locked out
      - Reason for delay is the result will be cached – once the
        successful query is received, it is cached for like a minute.
        you need 22 days to get 50% chance to beating the DNS server
  - Sounds like it's hard, but the attacker can fire off **multiple
    replies** with diff IDs – not constrained to one guess. If they
    responded 100 times before the real name, there's a high chance
  - And they can make requests for **multiple related domains** –
    1.foo.com, 2.foo.com
  - Basic idea is you can improve ur chances by correctly guessing the
    transaction ID
      - Once uve done that, uve poisoned the DNS cache of the machine
        you are targeting. Now when they visit the website expecting the
        DNS to take you to the right website, in fact you are taken to
        diff IP address that the attacker controls.
  - Cryptographic techniques come into rescue– fix is to securely
    authenticate, instead of transaction ID which is guessable.
  - DNSsec – uses digital signature to authenticate DNS queries. The
    idea is response issued by the server will be signed and the client
    can check the signature to see if it's a legit response DNS slow.
  - Another approach is ‘DNS on top of HTTPs –additional issues on how
    the queries are encrypted, but issue is that it makes everything
    secret and you can't see the DNS request, and can't guess if its
    legit or not

**ARP cache Poisoning**

  - ARP resolves IP to a MAC address – same idea of hijacking that
    resolution process
  - How it works, is the attack has to be on the local network – they
    could do that by finding a vulnerable machine in the connection. –
    now in the right place to be interfering with the process
  - What uve got is network, user, connected to the internet through a
    switch/hub. you are spoofing the gateway from the perspective of the
    user, and user from the perspective of the gateway – 2 ARP cache
    poisonings.
      - One to do with traffic from the user out to the internet, and
        other to do with stuff coming in. this is the problem of switch
        network that you won't see the traffic of different machine.
  - U position the ARP cache, which allows you to act as a man in the
    middle, as a victim and gateway to the internet and see all the
    traffic going back and forth.
  - Limitation – you need to be on the local network

**Remote Access: The Bad Old Days**

  - Moving up to the Application layer – like http, email protocols, and
    protocol for remote login
  - We used to use *telnet* or *rlogin* for remote login
  - If you wanted to copy files from/to remote machine– rcp, rsh to
    execute single commands and so on
  - **Problem w all of this is traffic is unencrypted**
  - *Telnet*, in addition to it being unencrypted, it required the use
    to always supply the username and password which travel in the air
    without protection– if someone intercepts the traffic using two
    methods above, it can see the credentials and everything else that
    was being typed
  - R tools – will recognize **trusted hosts** – can spoof the hosts tho
    although it avoids the need for
      - Only thing it does to check if it's trusted is to lookup the DNS
        host and see if it's in the trusted host file

**An Aside: ‘Banner Grabbing’**

  - Classic use of telnet was to log into diff ports of the machine –
    there are certain ports representing diff services, and well-known
    services will be known.
  - Same thing with telnet. It also has to specify the diff ports – if
    you do this you won't be connecting to a telnet server which support
    login but it's rather like connecting a client to the wrong server
      - E.g. telnet connected to port 22
      - **SSH-1.99-OpenSSH\_3.6.1p1+CAN-2004-0175**
      - Look at the response that come back – telnet can connect to SSH
        – so will get connection mismatch. But before you do that, we
        get **banners** – tells us what service is running. Can use this
        to query what's happening on the other end. **information
        disclosure threat**
  - Q: What is the Security issue with the highlighted bit
      - A: you see the version numbers – then you can look at what
        vulnerabilities are reported for that version, and someone can
        try to attack that system
      - Banners are for debugging purposes\!

**Sniffing a *telnet* Session**

  - Client talking to a server – what we see is not the
    telnet running, but is a result of dsniff running, which is a packet
    sniffing tool. There’re limitations on whether you see traffic, so
    you have to be on the gateway machine to sniff the ARP traffic. But
    we assume it's the case.
  - Dnsniff to spy the traffic passed to the client
  - Q: What do we see in that traffic? Username and pw\!\! Matthew and
    leedsutd

**Fixing it: Secure Shell (SSH)**

  - If telnet and rlogin aren’t good, how can we protect our traffic? We
    typically use SSH – secure shell.
  - Idea is it gives us a way to add cryptography to remote login and
    other r tools. For every one of the r tools there's a secure version
    of it.
      - Slogin, ssh, scp protected by encryption
  - Way it works is it uses public key cryptography and symmetric cipher
    is both used – there's an authentication aspect of it, using public
    key cryptography and to exchange the symmetric key of the session.
  - SSH1 & SSH2– 2 versions of protocol
      - RSA is the commonality of the two
      - SSH2 uses DSA – similar pub key algo but focuses on digital
        signature so is more about authentication.

**How does it work?**

  - We need to authenticate ourselves using key pair.
  - When the client connects, server provides public key and client can
    check it against a local db, or go to the verified certificate
    issuer itself.
  - That pub key can be used to encrypt authentication data sent to
    server
  - Client authentication
    1.  User can login by providing a valid pw, that is encrypted using
        the provided server pub key
    2.  Or to create ur own **SSH key pair** – and you can put the pub
        public key of that to the remote machine. And SSH will allow
        login if there's a corresponding private key.
          - It's like Gitlab\!\! Setting SSH, then ur allowed to login
            to that. Machine to that SSH if you have corresponding
            private key. The passphrase you need to provide Is cached so
            you don’t have to provide it repeatedly.

**SSH Problems**

  - Things can go wrong in the implementation like TLS
  - SSH1 had design flaws – deprecated.
  - SSH2 – superior but also had its own issue – CBC vulnerability in
    2008.
      - It allowed an attacker to recover plain text from the cipher
        text, but not very much of it. They could recover 14 bits with
        probability of 2 <sup>-14</sup>
      - When it translates into practice, it is quite a big chunk that
        is translated. If you got a lot of traffic, it can recover small
        chunk of it which can be serious enough to cause a problem

**‘Man In The Middle’ Attacks**

  - Another issue with SSH is MITM.
  - Attacker could steal credentials if they could impersonate the SSH
    server – and you may not notice if they forwarded everything to the
    real server. Might notice a slowdown tho.
  - We maintain a local store of trusted pub key from previously
    accessed server.
      - When it first connects, ‘do you trust this server?’ – then its
        stored. And from that point on ur okay
  - But it provides a small ‘window of opportunity’ – coz when it first
    asks you need to be sure that its safe
  - If you use SSH to connect – you will see ‘are you sure you want to
    continue connecting?’ and it adds to trusted host.

**Sending Email: SMTP**

  - One of the things we use a lot is email – in email, we got diff
    protocols to support sending and receiving
      - For a simple response – uses port 25
  - There is <span class="underline">no authentication</span>\!\! easy
    spoofing of sender
  - All traffic is sent as ASCII text – so you can just use telnet to
    just command it.
      - It <span class="underline">doesn’t chec</span>k the sender and
        recipient\!\! – Boris Johnson but it doesn’t care
  - Banner leaks information – name, vendor, version
  - EXPN and VRFY commands – to leak username and address

**Receiving Email: POP3& IMAP**

  - Pop3 – sends username and pw as a plaintext – although there's an
    extension to use shared secret and MD5, but extension isn’t always
    used.
  - IMPAP – also weak in terms of authentication, and mail itself is
    unprotected
  - No good from security standpoint

**Securing Email protocols**

  - Use SSH\! It allows us to **tunnel** insecure protocols over an
    encrypted channel.
  - No good anymore - now protocols been extended to support security.

**Tunnelling**

  - U set up ur mail client on local machine, and pop3 on mail host and
    it communicates with unencrypted channel. But if you encrypt it
    using SSH on both ends, you have an encrypted channel
  - We reconfigure the mail client to talk to port 5678 0 manually
    configure the email client where the SSH process is listed. On the
    other end, goes to SSH, port 22, and it connects to port 110 of the
    server.
  - ssh -f -N -L 5678:localhost:110 mailhost – all I need to set up a
    tunnel.
  - But we don’t need to do this bc there are better approaches.

**Better approaches**

  - There's a secure version of all of this – secure version of these
    email protocols have S on the front and they have their own
    alternative ports.
  - Is basically those standard email protocols that runs on top of TLS.
  - But then again, we don’t do this – bc there's ‘Opportunistic TLS’
      - Allows us to use standard port- coz above pollutes the space of
        port number with secure and insecure version. But instead, it
        allows you to switch from insecure to encrypted using
        “STARTTLS”- standard version to encrypted version
      - When you execute, then it triggers a TLS handshake and upgrade
        to secure version
  - But it could go wrong\!\!good eg is a STRIPTLS attack.

**STRIPTLS Attack**

  - It attacked two major ISPs in Thailand in 2014. It ran for few weeks
  - There's a transparent proxy intercepting the connection, SMTP
    connections, and silently removing START TLS command – it will fall
    back on authenticating over an unencrypted channel.
  - Problem is user never sees this\!\! Encryption is stripped away, and
    id and pw can be captured by the proxy.
  - Sometimes it's done deliberately – some cisco file will strip the
    TLS so they can examine emails.
  - That’s why if ur communicating anything sensitive, end to end
    encrypt, you need to encrypt the data urself\!\!

**Trade-offs**

  - Whilst it's desirable to use encrypted channel for email, but email
    is a common vector for malware – and ur encrypting the email you are
    losing the ability to examine the content and recognize that
    malware.

**Summary**
  - Seen that DNS and ARP are vulnerable to spoofing
  - Noted that traditional Unix tools for remote login, remote command
    execution and file transfer are very insecure, and that **SSH**
    provides secure drop-in replacements
  - Observed that email protocols also fail to adequately protect user
    credentials or message content
  - Learned that email can be protected in transit via **SSH
    tunnelling**, full TLS or **opportunistic TLS**
