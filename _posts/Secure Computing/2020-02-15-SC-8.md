## **8. TCP/IP networking threats**


**Objectives**
  - To review the layered network model and relevant protocols operating
    in the Internet and Transport layers
  - To consider how those protocols can be exploited to probe and attack
    systems

**Network Protocol Stack**

  - Idea of layering protocols on top of each other
  - Imagine the connection between application running on one machine to
    another. But that’s an illusion\!
  - IRL, our traffic is going down through the layers on one machine,
    broken into pieces called **TCP segments** or **UDP datagrams**, and
    this is packaged as **IP packets** **ethernet frames**, and those
    travel along the wire, and Ethernet to a **physical signal**,
    travelling along the wire or airwaves, and eventually reaches our
    dest.
  - Its routing our traffic to correct destination. We go up through
    protocols back down again.

**IP Packet Payloads**

  - The particular to interesting inside and IP packet is a chunk of
    data that performs 3-4 protocols
  - **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)– gives
    <span class="underline">reliable byte stream connection</span>,
    using **sequence numbers** to order the segments, and they can be
    reordered in the correct order. And after ordering, if somethings
    missing can <span class="underline">retransmit</span>.
      - But is time consuming\!\!

  - **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)– faster, but
    <span class="underline">less reliable</span>

      - No need for slow complicated handshake

  - **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) – all to do with
    <span class="underline">control of the routing</span> process and
    <span class="underline">reporting an error</span> back to the host

  - TCP UDP – M2M protocol – requires port no. and IP address. Port no
    located at particular service or app running on a machine, and
    there's a traffic coming into that machine that might be for many
    diff apps

**TCP & UDP Data Packaging**

  - There's a piece of app data- and first thing we do is to stick the
    header in the front of it. There’s different header provided by
    different protocols.
      - **TCP/UDP header** – port number for addressing scheme
  - Down one layer – is packaged as **IP packet** which adds an IP
    header of min 20 bytes.
      - **IP header** – IP addresses for source and destination- logical
        identifier for machines themselves
  - We go down to level of **ethernet** – another header in front of
    them, of 14 bytes.
      - **Frame header** – contains a MAC, aka physical address that
        addresses a specific network hardware
  - We are kind of sending a letter and adding envelope and diff
    addressing on each one

**IPv4 Header**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 6 39 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75276529-34f4f580-57fe-11ea-87fa-c4386f12820e.png)

  - between 0 and 31 bit – one chunk of 32 bits. And below there is another
    32-bit chunk, and so on.
  - Bottom is the **data**, and everything above the data is part of the
    header. && **Options –** info such as source route, record route.
    Used by network admin to check whether a path is working or not
      - **Payload** – identified if it is TCP segment or UDP datagram or
        ICMP msg
  - **Source/ destination address**- holds IP address’s source and
    destination
  - **Identification** – like a sequence number, together with source
    and destination with protocol – it identifies the packet
    <span class="underline">uniquely</span>
  - **Flags** in the flag section to identify fragmentation.
  - **Fragment offset** – reason why it’s there is you can have IP
    packet divided into chunks called **fragments**. It is coz it could
    be traversing a network which is not set up to handle the packet of
    that size. Protocol supports this by chunks, but those needs to be
    reassembled. it allows you to <span class="underline">determine
    where in the original packet</span> this fragment goes.
  - **Time to live** – like a counter. Determines how many hops you can
    go with this packet. Each time it goes to another hop, counter is
    decremented and if 0, can't route it further. Will get ICMP error
    msg.
  - **Checksum**, which helps integrity checking and to see if sths
    corrupted the header, but there is **<span class="underline">nothing
    cryptographic</span>**\!\! – nothing to stop attacker to change the
    detail of the header and the checksum. Thing to note is there is NO
    real protection\!\!

**Fragmentation**

  - MTU – maximum transition unit – largest chunk of data that can
    traverse the network
      - If MTU is smaller than the packet size – gotta travel in
        fragments or block it
  - If you fragment it you can reassemble it bc
    1.  All fragments from same packet has same id
    2.  And it stores its offset to the original unfragmented packet
    3.  And it knows if there are more fragments followed
  - This creates another **opportunity for attacks** – let’s say you
    have a packet that contains malicious. you might have detection
    system that scans it and looks at the payload – but if you divide it
    into a smaller packet, it won't notice\!\! fragments aren’t detected
    unless you can scan after reassembly happens
  - Also, if there are bugs in the network stack in terms of how
    fragmentation is handled, you can exploit those and crack the
    machine


**TCP Header**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 6 41 28 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75276628-708fbf80-57fe-11ea-9ea5-c23d0d2b50a5.png)  
  - 32-bit chunks of header – each row is 32 bit chunk, and there's app
    data in the bottom
  - But now there's no need to identify the machine, hence no IP
    addresses, but we need to focus on services running on that machine
    using port number
  - **Source and dest port** –determine the service
  - **Sequence number** – counter
  - **ACK number** – sending ack to client, and count up to acknowledge
    the one that its received
  - \!\! fairly imp **FLAGS**
      - SYN, ACK – used in handshaking
      - RST, FIN - To terminate the connection
      - These flags can be attacked – each of them has a role in the
        protocol – those bits will be set to 1 to indicate that specific
        segment has specific roles. But attacker could change those bits
        and misuse the protocol – how does the implementation of the
        protocol on a machine deal with this abuse?
  - **Checksum** – but is not cryptographic at all. Can be altered
  - **Reserved** bit – not used for anything specific, but this means
    attacker could use them w/o affecting the use of that TCP segment.
    It will behave normally even if attacker changes this like a secret
    communication channel – can send 6 bit per TCP segment in that chunk
    w/o affecting it anyways. But they need to retrieve the value which
    needs rootkit which requires privileges

**TCP Handshaking**

  - <span class="underline">Full duplex connection</span> – can send
    data both ways. And it needs to be closed down the both sides- each
    side sends FIN and ACK, incrementing and sending back its own
    sequence number

**Security Perspective**

  - Thing to note about this protocol is that **there is NO security** –
    it was not designed in an env that security was concerned.
  - No guarantees of confidentiality, authenticity and integrity.
    Checksum isn’t secure checksums
  - So protocols can be abused
      - To conduct reconnaissance and to actively attack
        victims
  - What the attackers tryna do is use the advantage to protocol that
    was not anticipated by the designers

**Intelligence Gathering**

  - One of the goals of the attacker is to discover what’s there in the
    network. There are two ways for attackers to do this:

  - **ICMP echo requests** – or ‘ping sweep”

      - Ping a host to see if the host is alive. Specify an address and
        you get a reply
      - If no host – host unreachable from the router.
          - No host reply is important coz it can be used to
            <span class="underline">inverse mapping of the
            network</span>
      - Information disclosure and whether or not you can stop this to
        protect info about ur network
      - **Q**: But why should you not block it entirely? Be careful to
        not block everything
          - **A**: coz it also <span class="underline">stops us from
            receiving notification about packets that it needs to be
            fragmented</span> **AND** it would stop us from
            <span class="underline">receiving notification that a server
            was down</span>.
          - So, if I block echo rq and reply – the replies tell you that
            the machine is down if we block it all

  - **TCP scans**

      - It can tell you what’s running on that machine, using scanning.
      - Noisiest way– is to try to establish a connection but slow
        due to 3-way handshakes v obvious as there's a pattern to
        establish
      - But you can just not complete a 3-way handshake, and do the
        <span class="underline">half open connection</span> – SYN scan
          - Not complete 3-way handshake
          - If there's an open port that you wanna connect to, respond
            with SYN, ACK when its open to connection, RST value for
            closing
      - More efficient, but can be detected as you see the signatures of
        a lot of SYNs and RST – you can see the patterns Make it smarter
        by breaking into segments OR can also use doing UDP

**Stealthier TCP scanning**

  - **ACK scan** –sending back ACK, acknowledging the connection that
    came to you from the machine ur scanning. Doesn’t make sense if you
    don’t initiate the connection.
      - Bc ur not relying on the handshakes, all the firewalls won't
        recognize
      - Specific response you get from opening and Closing ports -
      - Ull find signatures in logs

  - **FIN scan**
      - As if ur ending a connection
      - Specific type of response and signs you see in the log
        stealthier. Coz firewalls looking at the state, but it'll miss
        it.

  - → but is not reliable coz it depends on how implementation of network
    protocol works– diff OS respond differently to these scans. But this
    itself is useful coz you detect the responses depend on diff types
    of segment you send– it’s like fingerprinting ur machine. Depending
    on the response you can tell if its Linux, windows, etc

**Intelligence Gathering Tools**

  - Traceroute -sends packets with increasing TTL – make one further
    hop. Since you get a response back when it hits 0. Collect it and
    map out each step of the journey- useful coz you can look at the
    steps and map where the routers could be
      - Info about network architecture - Last hop is the destination
        machine, second to last is the firewall, and third is an
        external router.
      - E.g. for us to get to google, it has to go from uni network
        ja.net google


  - **OS fingerprinting** – if you got a db of how TCP IP stack responds
    to packets, then you can use that to identify the OS that ur
    connected to
      - Useful coz it helps you to estimate how easily sequence number
        can be predicted – predicting this is what you wanna do if you
        wanna hijack session.

**Types of Attack**

  - Less imp - **Packet sniffing -** Places you can capture traffic is
    limited coz of the nature of architecture

**1. Spoofing of Identity**
  - U are making the network think it’s a diff machine – e.g. changing
    the source of the IP address
  - But you are flying blind – any response goes to the spoof address
    not to u. harder to attack coz ur not looking at the responses.
  - They could try **Source routing** – you can set desired spots and
    make sure it goes through these sources\!\!
      - Specify source routing so you can see the result coming to u.
        but this is usually blocked.
  - But you can just attack from a compromised host – you don’t want it
    to be traced back to u. so if uve already compromised another
    computer, you can just mount the attack from that machine coz it
    can't get traced back.

**2. Session Hijacking**

  - Idea is you have a machine that ur victim is using which is
    connected to server, it will prompt to enter credential and it
    hijacks that connection after they logged in
      - So you wanna get access to account, without knowing the
        credentials.
  - Gotta DoS their machine so that it doesn’t connect to server
    anymore, and you hijack the session by spoofing the ip address of
    the victim and predicting sequence number of the next TCP segment–
    hard if you use good PNRGS\!\!\!
  - Disadvantages – hard if you use good PRNG, **AND** attacker is
    flying blind
      - If you get the sequence number wrong – ull get ACK storm – lots
        of ACKs flying around
  - Hard to do but is possible

**3. Denial of Service Attacks**
  - Goal is to render a server unavailable to the users of that service.
    And many ways of doing it:
      - Focus on weaknesses in protocol –crashing the server by
        exploiting the weakness then there’s no need to worry about the
        overflowing volume
      - But usually brute force it and flood it – typical is to use
        **botnet** to simultaneously bombard the server with traffic-
        DDoS

**Protocol abuse - Past Examples**
  - **Ping of death** – can construct a ICMP echo rq, play around w the
    fragment setting – max value and size
      - When you try to reassemble it, it will exceed and overrun memory
        buffer
      - Weakness in the implementation of the protocol that is failing
        to check if the fragment setting was sensible
  - **Teardrop –** create bunch of fragments and overlap offsets, so
    when you reassemble it can make some system crash
      - Old 1997, but there are similar kind of attacks - in Linux
        kernel – sack(selective ack) packaged was handled wrong, so its
        possible to trigger a kernel panic. If you send malicious file

**Overwhelming a server**

  - **Slowloris**
      - DDoS where ur overwhelming server to request – pool of HTTP pool
      - Without botnet, one machine can take it down
          - Open as many http and send partial rq that never completes –
            there’s pool of thread that server can use, when the pool
            gets tied up, no more connection and nothing can be used
      - Was used to target Iranian gov to election


  - **SYN Floods**
      - Generate fake packets with SYN flags and spoofed source IP and
        bombard it w packets
      - Queue of half open connections that TCP stack maintain, which
        you can quickly fill, which will <span class="underline">block
        others from accessing it</span>
      - SYN cookies – avoid maintaining half open connection

**A DDoS Attack Tool: TFN**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75276848-d7ad7400-57fe-11ea-819c-24703d01be2d.png)
  - Relying on the volume of traffic a large network traffic can issue

<!-- end list -->

1.  Attacker installs a large number of compromised hosts aka zombies –
    botnets
      - Compromised by malware etc
2.  TFN master activates zombies using ICMP echo **REPLY** packets-
    **reply** coz you gotta make it look like a reply\!\! Which won't be
    blocked. Ping might be.
3.  Once zombies are activated, each machine is directed to flood a
    particular victim, and what type of attack to mount.
      - flood victim with SYN packets, UDP etc

**DDoS by Consent**

  - Coordinated group of users agree to run the same software
    deliberately to DDOs a target site
  - Arose from activism - for political reasons
  - e.g. High Orbit Ion Cannon

**The Future?**
  - Much more worrying because of **IoT** – which shows billions of
    devices on the network, and that accessible
  - Poor security makes easier for botnets as a recruitment target
  - E.g.
      - Sept 2016, ‘Krebs on Security blog’
      - DDoSed with 620Gb/s which relied on a botnet comprised of IoT
        devices like video recorders, security cameras
      - Used Mirai

**Mirai Botnet**

  - Target in particular manufacturers of different devices
  - Used the fact that there are a large number of default accounts \!\!
    authentication, factory values
  - 380,000 devices for the botnet\!\!\!\!\!\!

**Summary**

  - Reviewed features of the TCP/IP stack that make it vulnerable to
    attack
  - Discussed how attackers can do network reconnaissance using ICMP,
    UDP or TCP-based scans
  - Seen how it is possible to spoof identity or even hijack an active
    TCP session
  - Considered various examples of DoS & DDoS
