##  Amazon's surveillance can boost output and possibly limit unions: study
- **Who:**  Amazon
- **What:**  Through an increasing surveillance, the company aims to boost employee output and potentially limit unionization efforts around the United State.
- **Why:**  To track employees and maintain a healthy workforce, and also to track time they spend working as more people telecommute. In addition, amazon uses the data to support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve.
- **How:**  
  - Amazon uses such tools as navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras, security cameras and recorded footage to surveil its workforce in warehouses and stores.
  - The data creates heat maps and uses data such as team-member sentiment and a diversity index to figure out which of its stores may have a higher risk of unionizing.
- **So?:**
  - This can have an impact on workers’ ability to advocate for better working conditions and push for collective action.
  - However, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute (OMI) claims that company should prohibit extensive surveillance, and if they have to, they need to obtain approval from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
