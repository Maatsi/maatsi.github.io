## **7. User authentication**


**Objectives**

  - For you to recognize the main approaches that exist for **user
    authentication**
  - For you to understand the theoretical and practical levels of
    security achievable with <span class="underline">passwords</span>
  - For you to appreciate the benefits and limitations of
    <span class="underline">security tokens and biometrics</span>

**Basis for Authentication**

  - **Authentication**: As a system, specific individuals get granted
    access to that system. Can they prove their identity to that system
    to have access?
      - Diff users will have diff level of permission
  - **Something you know**: bit of secret information - PIN, password,
    passphrase
  - **Something you have**: physical security token -key, smartcard
  - **Something you are**: some properties of you that are diff from
    other people - Biometric measurement
  - Ur ability to keep that bit of information and not guessable by
    anyone else. And if it is short, 4 digits, there are only limited
    number of possibilities. && Your ability hold of that token to not
    lose it – have a copy?

**How many passwords?**

  - Most prevalent is the password
  - Password - Sth that you must type on a std keyboard
  - **Solution**
      - N unique characters that can be typed
          - N\~\~ 95for UK keyboard
      - Length = 8, so N<sup>L</sup> possibilities. 95<sup>8</sup>
        password possibilities
      - 6.6 quintillion\!
  - The longer ur password is, more secure it is, but it is possible to
    brute force.
  - Password sounds like a good approach, yet they are not in practice a
    good authentication device coz its used by humans and we don’t wanna
    remember all these strings. So we only have a limited space.
    (\~8digits)

Cases where passwords were revealed

  - **2005: GNER Control Center**
      - Can get pretty extreme – need to have this password
      - He was on a train from Leeds to London. GNER produced the
        LiveWire – inflight magazine
      - And he picked it up and read it, and he came across that GNER
        was opening a control center in York. And he came across a pic
        that has username and pw written down. Password = TRAIN\!\! Wtf
      - And its written on a white board – anyone could see it. And it
        was in a magazine that could be read by users


  - **2014: Winter Floods**
      - Top right of the white board they could see the username and pw


  - **2015: Waterloo Station**
      - BBC – but they had password written down on the top of the
        monitor - Password3


  - **2016: Labour Leadership Contest**
      - When you zoom in the white board – you could see username and pw
        with client ID and in a white board


  - **2018: Trump Administration**
      - White house staff wrote a password and address in a white house
        stationary and left it at the bus stop

<!-- end list -->

  - In theory, password, when long enough, is a reasonable
    authentication device. BUT the problem is people write it down and
    publish photo on the internet.

**Conclusions**

  - Problem is people want the pw to be easy to remember – we have a very
    small region of ‘password space’
  - Phases that are meaningful to them – e.g. bday
  - If you chose sth that it’s not easy, ull write it down\! Likely.
    This is further compounded coz other people can see the pwd

**Other Risks**

  - **Factory defaults** – where a piece of hardware or software ships w
    default pwd – when you set it up, ull delete the account or change
    it. But it isn’t usually done\! you have access with high privelege
      - PDP and mapd - out of the box – id:field, pwd:service .So they
        can come to ur business and reset. But it was common for people to
        use this default account. So, if you knew about this, ull have a
        high privilege access.

<!-- end list -->

  - ‘**Shoulder surfing’** – walking past, looking over someone’s
    password

  - **Social engineering** – active persuasion by sounding convincing.

  - **Keystroke loggers / Trojans –** follows whatever you are typing,
    and steal the credentials/ data

  - **Live brute-forcing**- systematically tryna logging in by brute
    forcing. Solution - Limit the number of attempts and lock you out.
    But it could be used maliciously to lock you out. And with admin
    account, you don’t wanna mistype it and force you out as an
    admin\!\!

  - **Cracking of stolen hashes -**

  - **Information leakage in system logs** – could record fail login
    attempt. For this id and pw used will be recorded as fail - gives
    idea of what’s right and make it guessable. It could log mistyped pw
    too

**Social Engineering**
  - Is done on a large scale using phishing and more targeted to a
    specific individual
      - U get a phone call – and you know there's TOM in IT, and you
        have a CRM server. So you think yh maybe. Much more likely to
        fool non-technicals who doesn’t know that they’d never ask for
        pw
  - It could be an info can be found out in the back of office, looking
    for thrown out documents which could make you sound like a plausible
    insider
  - Active persuasion – by sounding convincing.

**KeySweeper**
  - Devious example coz its designed to look like a phone charger
  - And when it connects, it has a battery, so even if you plug it out
    it'll work.
  - It sniffs keystrokes and logs them in this device, and you can steal
    id and pw, and send credentials via SMS
  - E.g. – looks like an apple USB cable – but inside is built
    electronic firmware that allows you to steal info

**Cracking Stolen Hashes**

  - Biggest problem of them all
  - When pw is stored, it should store as hashes. But the hashes can get
    stolen. And they get stolen and often offered for sale- like in
    LinkedIn.
  - Price halved – bc once the announcement is out, people will change
    it So limited window opportunity when it has high value – so attempt
    to sell it.
  - In hash form, some processing is required to recover what the pw
    are. So how does it work?- UNIX

**UNIX-style Passwords**

  - Traditionally, not anymore, the idea was to use DES cipher – and
    essentially encrypt a string repeatedly using a variant DES, and
    treating pw as a key. And output was stored as a hash.
  - We dont just store the hash, we compute the **hash on pw+ salt
    (random**)
      - coz if we only store hash, it’ll be crackable for attackers to
        have a <span class="underline">lookup table and pre compute
        possible hashes</span>, and match it up.
  - The success depends on the size of the lookup table, but it can be
    successful.
  - Way to make it a bt harder is to introduce randomness- same pw
    doesn’t always produce same hash. So even if the user uses same
    pw, it would be a diff hash.
      - 12 bits of salt – 2^12 possible hash for individually pw– the
        size for ur lookup table is way bigger now
      - If the size is bigger, its impractical to keep the lookup or
        store it on a disk


  - why we use salt
      - The **hash = salt+ hash** = aavFyamradh aa is our hash
      - And if you change the salt hash changes completely
      - But the limitation is it only took the first 8 characters – so
        kangaroo and kangaroos made same hash\!\!

**Cracking Stolen UNIX Hashes**

  - Assume ur not brute forcing and you stole the hash and you wanna
    crack the hash. you can't invert it in a simple way, but you gotta
    generate all pw, hash it and see if it matches up
  - But people don’t choose word from a word list – common technique you
    use to vary the dictionary words - is to change o to 0, add numbers
    in front, etc
  - For every word, you **generate the variatio**n, and **you** compute
    the **hash** **for each variation**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75276341-de87b700-57fd-11ea-8d12-00692b9bf959.png)
  - Simple but remarkably successful – 20-35% of pw can be cracked
    \!\!\! wtf
      - Bigger the wordlist, longer it takes but more possibilities to
        crack

**Physical Tokens &2FA**

  - Password is not the only option – we use physical tokens too
  - Pws are flawed – so combining with a second authentication to have
    **two-factor authentication**
  - E.g. mobile phone, smartcard, YubiKey
      - YubiKey – when you plug it in ur computer, when you touch the
        button, it generates OTP – whenever you get a prompt to input a
        pwd, and you touch it and it inputs it
      - Authenticator app on ur phone also generates PIN that are only
        valid for short – and with conjunction with ur pw – not as good
        as yubikey but still
  - Supply **OTP** with normal pw you have for ur system

**Biometrics**
  - Good for user coz there's nothing to lose and forget – most
    convenient
  - But can be expensive to implement
  - Choosing the right traits
      - Voice – can be faked, affected by mood and age, cold
      - Fingerprints – widely used
      - Facial geometry
      - Eyes – retinal blood vessels or iris texture

**Some Examples**

  - Windows Hello– face recognition
      - Near IR images – to prevent holding a photo of someone
      - And samples texture around the landmark points
      - Has a depth sensor built in
  - Apples touchID and faceID
      - But can create a realistic finger model to scan it
  - Not an authentication used as a security aids necessarily

**Iris Codes**

  - Indian gov was using this – you look at the iris and there's a
    pattern that’s unique to u, and you do that into binary 256 byte of
    data – iris code
  - 2 code that computes from same iris – 90% match
  - Microsoft’s Lumia uses this

**The Revocation Problem**

  - Real problem is what if you have biometrics stored in a server
    somewhere and this gets stolen?
  - Password is **revocable**. If it gets hacked, get a new one. But you
    cant have new eyes\!\! Eyeballs transplant lol
  - So, <span class="underline">combine biometric factor and revocable
    factor, and hash it all together and store this</span>
      - If stolen, revoke the hash and change the hash and update it.


**Summary**

  - Seen that, although the space of possible passwords is typically
    quite large, passwords are often poorly chosen / written down by
    users
  - Discussed a range of other password-related risks
  - Considered how easy it is to crack stolen password hashes
  - Noted that 2FA strengthens password authentication by combining it
    with a physical token
  - Examined some popular biometric techniques
