**The cold start problem**  
  - **Cold star**t - If you have insufficient information about the user
    and cannot initiate the adaptation
      - classic issue in user modelling and adaptation
  - E,g, of insufficient info
      - Amazon – not enough info so it recommends you popular ones
      - When the information about the user is noisy and have to exclude
        info resulting in limited information diluted information
  - What do you do then?
      - Can narrow down to something that is most related; but how?
      - Can open up and have dialogue with them
      - To make them explicitly rate the item
      - Put user into
      broader category and assume what they’d like
  - Travel agent
      - Since you are a student and ask if you are venturer, then
        recommends you what other people in the same category likes


### Concept of a ‘stereotype’
  - Was introduced in 1979 with what it is and how it is represented
  - Frame based representation – fundamental underneath
  - Quite intuitive – e.g. someone is a seasoned traveller, teenager,
    venturer - we categorize and recommend
  - Why?
      - Research challenge coz it hides individual traits and put it
        into category
      - Getting popular now coz we have better representation of the
        category –  way to handle large amount of users
      - We don’t have time to learn about each individual
  - How to handle the stereotype
    1.  How to represent
    2.  How are we gonna build it – info about the user, how to assign a category
    3.  How to maintain the category


**Stereotype: definition**
  - Stereotype is a knowledge structure that represents frequently
    occurring characteristics of users
      - The large amt of data about different users and past users, will
        allow us to mine that data and identify the frequency occurring
        characteristics
      - There is rating of possibilities
  - We can infer or assign plausible inferences – cannot be sure for
    100% but since they are common category, you are making plausible
    inference
  - We have small number of observations about the user – we know little
    about the user
  - E.g. about her lecture, she knows where people struggle and try to
    adapt to it


**Scenario: Travel information system**
  - We have a simple explicit user model
  - **User registers** and tells very little about themselves about their
    demographic information
      - We are not asking about interest, destination, kind of hotels
        etc
      - small number of observations
  - Then, we will be looking at **categories**
      - Married with kids
      - Professional
      - Students
  - We will assume that our system has a way to adapt to each category –
    and how from this register information how we gonna assign and give
    users recommendation


### Stereotype: Structure
  - **Body,** aka the frame
    - Information that is typically true for users to whom the
      stereotype applies
        - **Facets** - characteristics
        - **Values** – to quantify / qualify the facets
        - **Ratings** – degree of certainty for facet-value pairs

  - **Trigger**
    - **Logical** condition that has to be satisfied for the user to
      be in that category
        - E.g Age of \>20 \<60
    - Occurrence of events which signal appropriateness of particular
      stereotypes – i.e. can associate a user with a stereotype
    - Can add a **probability value against** it – if the user
      satisfies the trigger, what's the prob of user entering the
      stereotype
    - How the probability is defined:
        - Either ask an expert
        - Look at the dataset and calculate the frequency

  - **Relations**
    - Between the stereotype and other stereotypes in the system (for
        more complex models)


**Stereotype: Professional**
- ![Screenshot 2020-10-26 at 3 47 14 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/97141667-85b05a00-17a2-11eb-80ba-22fa86c63e08.png)
- It is a **frame-based** representation
- The entire thing is the **body** – facets, values, ratings
  1.  **Facets** corresponds to items you are recommending
  2.  Each facet has **values** – can have one or more values that are
      relevant
        - Facet ‘entertainment’ will have lot of values – but you ONLY
          put values that are relevant your category
  3.  Third stereotype body is **rating**
        - Rating comes from frequency of the past users OR
        - If we talk about travel assistance, we can ask them

- Trigger
    - **Logical condition** that has to be satisfied for the user to
      be in that category
    - Little about the user – demographics, and you want to pull out a
      lot to suggest plausible inferences
    - (age\>20) and age \<60, and job in ListProgessionalJobs)
    - Not a cold start anymore
    - P = 0.2 - **probability value against** it – if the user
      satisfies the trigger, what's the prob of user entering the
      stereotype


### Limitations of stereotyping
  - May fall in more than one stereotype and can **contradict** each
    other
  - Bc by putting it in the category, **individual users might not fit
    into that category – fundamental challenge
  - Having predefined categories; user may not fit in any of it –
    **excludes subset of the user**


**Combining stereotypes inferring a user model**
  - **profile ->  stereotypes -> inferred user model**
  - In our system about traveller system we have very little information
    about the user -> we decide which trigger -> decide stereotype -> from
    several stereo we combine and come up with an inferred user model
  - Assume we have a specific user: Charlie, 27, single, IT consultant.
      - -> He satisfied stereotype of: ‘professional’ and ‘male’
  - ![Screenshot 2020-10-26 at 3 48 09 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/97141737-a8db0980-17a2-11eb-8de6-212b47e06d5b.png)
    - Charlie falls into two categories


  - **If the stereotype falls into more than one category:**
    - ![Screenshot 2020-10-26 at 3 49 49 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/97141850-e344a680-17a2-11eb-99c2-fe0f875b4cf6.png)
    - we combine the two using the 'union rule'


**Probability when in one stereotype**
  - **Ps<sub>tereotype</sub>(feature=value) = P (feature =
    value|stereotype) \* P(stereotype)**


### Combining stereotypes
  - Use probability of **union** rule \!\!
      - **P (A∪B) = P(A) + p(B) - p(A\*B) = union**
  - E.g. How likely does Charlie like to travel long distance?- distance
    ‘long’
      - Stereotype A = Man, B = Professional
      - P (distance = ‘long’) = P(distance=‘long’ | man) +
        P(distance=‘long’ | Professional) – P( man\*prof)
      - \= (0.5\*0.8) + (0.8\*0.7) – (0.4\*0.56) = 0.4+0.56 – 0.24 =
        **0.72**



### Building stereotypes
  - But then where does this stereotype come from???????
  - What is the stereotype? The trigger w probability and the body.
    Initially this is how stereo was built.


1.  **Asking experts**
      - Asking humans who have experienced these users – who have
        experience with the users
          - e.g. travel agents, teachers
      - Ask several diff experts
          - \- But the challenge here is they may come w diff facets,
            value and ratings
      - If they are suggesting diff facets, need to decide on which
        based on your
          - **Majority v**oting
          - **Priorities** – more experienced experts rated higher
      - Seek consensus if there are several diff experts


2.  **Obtaining stereotypes form media**
      - Use the data about the user that is available to build
        stereotypes
      - Decide the attributes to use – what can you measure about the
        user.
      - Identifies meaningful **clusters** based on the selected
        attributes
          - What stereotypes look like, is a cluster – a group of users
            form the data that exhibits similar behaviour - method used
            here is **clustering**
      - **Analyse the cluster – most crucial\!**
          - Within the cluster what are the characteristics of the
            people that fall into that cluster, that identifies the
            cluster? What may be the interesting things about the user?
          - Which of those variables differ across different clusters?
          - Then based on that define the characteristics of the
            cluster, find facets and values
      - Form the stereotypes need to bring in the human
          - To decide if it is meaningful or not cluster
          - To name the cluster based on the characteristics


### Resolving stereotype contradictions
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95708275-c97d6c80-0c96-11eb-8155-6123968789dd.png)
- Can have general vs specific
    - E.g. Undergrad student and student
    - **Specific** can inherit from generic
- BUT what if there's a **contradiction**?
    - If its specific, generic you take the **specific**. This provides more insight for that group
    - Rule of thumb: decide **priority**. Then exclude other
    - Make the user choose which category they consider themselves as
  - Why not take the union?
      - By default you can, but you won't please either of them. Not
        relevant to nowhere

**Stereotype tuning**
  - We tune rating and the values
  - IF
      - If evidence shows that the predictions based on stereotypes were
        correct --> should be preserved for the future
      - NOT correct should be amended in the future
  - You are preserving what's happening, and you are constantly
    recommending something
  - Need to think of what you are tuning
      - Have to tune trigger
      - Rating
      - Facet
  - How? Done by asking human AND data as you learn from historic data,
    so you can look at **new data**
