  - Intelligent system **to make smarter decisions, preserve knowledge,
    learn** from experience and change behaviour
  - This model is understanding the users and how we gonna adapt to
    those users
  - Also understanding the connectivity, taking into account the world
    and users
  - Ideas of nudging – can nudge the ppl to do better things – amazon
    nudging us to buy stuff

**The personalisation buzz**
  - Having a computer system to adapt to users
      - Tailored to what we need, want and best fits current state
  - Human to human interaction and personalisation is natural
      - Speaking very slow
      - Recommending what to buy
  - BUT can we adapt the human AND the **computer** and can this be
    personalised?
  - How to make systems that are not personalised to personalised.
      - Minerva – not tailored - how do we tailor the website to suit each student?

**Past: Need for personalisation**
  - Whenever something is modified in its configuration or behaviour by
    information about the user, this is personalisation
  - Industries should not think if to personalise or not, instead u
    gotta think HOW you are gonna personalise !!
  - If we are delivering info, we need: right info to the right person, at right time in right way
      - **right** \!\!\! is the smartness


**Today**
  - We are using personalisation from different industries
      - Ecommerce – amazon, ebay etc
      - Search – you'll get 2 different response if you search for 2 different laptop
      - Mobile devices and desktops
      - Variation of personalised digital portals – newspaper, libraries
        etc

**Why do we need personalisation?**
  - Key factors – **right** right right
  - Available info
      - Heterogeneity – is overwhelming so gotta help them find the
        right info
      - Noise
      - Constraints – bandwidth and time – how much you can absorb all
        these information
      - To narrow down the information

  - People
      - In the past, we had program used by typical users used
        uniformly. However, the systems we use, we have massive users
        with different **capabilities and background**, So you need to adapt
      - different task, goal, intentions
      - different context – in different settings and what info
      - Affective states – emotional. Not exactly clear what effect it
        has



**Two Types of personalisation – 2<sup>nd</sup> core slide**
  - **Adaptable systems (customisable)**
      - User is able to modify aspects of the system to suit their
        preferences
          - I wanna get these types of news and you set up a filter
      - Limitation – they don’t know what and how to customize
      - Plus – interface wise, to get the user to pick and mix
  - **Adaptive systems**
      - Automatically changes their behaviour due to smart engine
        independent of user specifications
          - YouTube recommendation
      - \!\! Core part of this module
  - Intermediate cases
      - System proposes possible adaptations and user decides to accept

**User adaptive system & AI**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/95707624-fa5ca200-0c94-11eb-9c16-b06f449a8a10.png)
  - No human
      - Ai could be just one – simple automated intelligence
      - Capable of taking decisions itself – autonomous intelligence

**Example: user-ADAPTABLE interface**
  - Web browser - Can change layout and what to see, choose content
  - Human Computer Interaction

**\!\! Example; user ADAPTIVE interface**
  - Start menu in windows. It narrow downs the program of what programs
    user consume and it picks that as the users preferred option
  - Limitations – too many and not adaptive, hence not regular
      - Narrowing down the users, and it takes long to find it
      - Then go back to customisation and ask them
      - We use spatial memory to know whereabouts stuff are – causes
        confusion. For e.g in different languages and you uses spatial memory

**More recent examples**
  - MoCoMapps
      - Massive amt of information of cities and how to encourage ppl to
        contribute to it. How social technologies can help cities be
        smarter – civic engagement, tourism,
      - Customizable interface
      - Specifies the types of data --> customization
      - It takes what's important for the person and recommends it – adaptive

  - Ecoach
      - Mid agent of Minerva – you register and fill in personal info
      - Asks to do a psychometric test to identify learners’ motivational factors
      - Links to uni's student information page
      - And it gives simple adaptations such as reminders and feedbacks
      - Recommendations of adaptive content in a motivational way

  - Google map – if you rate then it gives you recommendations of new places you might like

**Personalisation from consumer perspective**
  - 80% of consumers stick to a business if the system is
    personalised
  - Personalisation improves the customer experience
  - What do they see as personalisation?
      - Customisation - something suited to me so I'm more interested
      - Service – companies will know what I want and help w the
        experience
      - Discount and offers – personalised offers
      - Specific products that are tailored to them
      - Convenience with user
  - What do we notice here?
      - This is looking at the positives – and that the data collected
        is used for their convenience
  - Top personalisation experiences
      - Coupon, discounts - 31% that provides discounts due to
        personalisation
  - Top company - Amazon
  - What do you want to see in personalised message?
      - Recognition of who they are
      - Help them buy stuff

**Personalisation of business perspective**
  - 50% of companies are providing personalisation
  - What could be the possibility of personalisation?
      - Recommender, personal shopper, diagnostic, filter, teacher user
        adaptive intelligent system
