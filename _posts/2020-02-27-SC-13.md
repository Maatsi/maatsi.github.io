## **13. Low-level vulnerabilities**


**Objectives** – low level

  - To explore how C’s printf functions can be abused **(SIN 6**)
  - To consider vulnerabilities in the way that c++ supports dynamic
    binding of method calls
  - To understand the risk of careless integer arithmetic (**SIN 7**)
  - To discuss mitigations of these issues

**Format string bugs**

  - These affect the printf family of C standard library – but also
    sprint - vulnerable
  - Known for long time – 1999 and there’s been a lot vulnerabilities in
    the past mainly after 1999
  - V easily spotted by compiler auditing tools – most compilers will
    warn us when using printf wrong
  - Why is there a problem in printf?

**Format string bugs II**

  - Correct way– printf("%s", user\_input);
      - to use %s to format input and feed the value to be formatted -
        user input
  - Incorrect – printf(user\_input);
      - Bc the first argument of printf is a string and string contains
        a formatting directive but doesn’t have to, it can just be text
        w/o directive.
      - What if this user input string contains
        <span class="underline">formatting directives</span>? Printf is
        expecting a formatting string containing any format directives,
        then there would be corresponding values supplied as arguments.
        But in this eg there isn’t.

**Information disclosure threat**
  - In the absence of suitable arguments, prinf takes the values need by
    the format string **from the stack**
  - Rather than giving compiler error, it takes whatever’s on the stack.
    Hence you can use this to see what's on the stack
  - So if the attacker provide that format string as an input and can
    see the output of printf – way of probing stack contents\!\! –
    looking at values of variables they have access to.

E.g. - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75279251-2bba5780-5803-11ea-86f7-d6d5e7c95780.png)
  - printf has 8 formatting directives but without variables – you can
    see what's on the stack\!\!

**Code execution threat**

  - Weird thing with printf – you can use this to write to memory\! How?
    Coz there's a special formatting directive %n.
  - %n writes the number of characters formatted so far, to a given
    memory.
  - If no address is supplied as an argument, then the memory address
    written to will be taken from the stack
  - Attacker can construct a format string by injecting an address onto
    stack, and generate the value to be stored in that address when
    printf runs
  - This gives you a way to overwrite the function return address,
    pointer, and pointing the shellcode

  - E.g.
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75279276-383eb000-5803-11ea-83fa-39c6b8de457d.png)
      - Print bunch of periods, and using %n to supply the address of
        \&i.
  - If the attacker can somehow provide both the value to be written and
    the memory address to which it should be written, it may be possible
    to them to gain control of program execution.
  - This is a design flaw in printf – the risk

**Palo Alto VPN bug**

  - Historical bug, BUT in July, it happened
  - Shocked that it’s still being found in 2019- printf bug of VPN
    appliances, even on uber
  - Other point is that Palo Alto – their research paper find that they
    found it in the old version. What happened is that they fixed and
    shut up about it
      - Ethics of that action- concealing the bug to the client isn’t a
        professional nor ethical thing to do. It could be a serious bug
        that may cause a significant impact in the future, and client
        data could have already been exploited or is in a vulnerable
        state. Concealing it may keep the company’s credibility and
        reputation of the software high, but clients have the right to
        know about the state of software they are using.

**C++ VTable attacks**
  - Dynamic binding – happens when we have inheritance, and in
    subclasses that overwrites methods defined in the superclass.
      - It is all about making decisions on runtime about which method
        gets called on an object based on the actual type­ of the object
        on runtime, not the type of reference to it in the code
  - Decision on which method to be called is made by looking at the type
    of the object and referencing a lookup table – **VTable** – virtual
    methods is what triggers VTable, which decides what methods to call-
    one that bind inside that class or one that’s been inherited
  - In C++ you gotta turn it on explicitly. By defining using ‘virtual’
    \[vptr.xpp\]

  - E.g.
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75279322-4c82ad00-5803-11ea-8454-c2d6a446c3fa.png)
      - Only difference btwn classes are ‘virtual’ – meaning that
        dynamic binding is possible.
      - Result – the size of the VirtualThing is bigger\!\! 32 bytes –
        coz it contains a VTable and a VPtr to reference the **VTable**.


  - So how does the attack work?
      - If we supply input that overruns the buffer contained within the
        VirtualThing object, we can overwrite the VPtr to make it point
        to a fake VTable that references shellcode.
      - **VPtr** is a pointer to the VTable, and allows you to lookup in
        runtime what method to call
      - When methods are invoked, shellcode is executed


**C++ VTable attacks**

![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 7 18 50 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75279520-a84d3600-5803-11ea-8fa4-98ae935d78fc.png)
  - We have an object and one of the fields is buffer which could be
    overwritten, and VPtr is on the end after the definition of the
    memory
  - What happens is the attacker overruns the buffer bc user input is
    used but no checking on the size done, then they’ve overrun the
    buffer, other instance variables and VPtr.
  - **After**: The payload, VPtr, contains fake VTable which the
    function pointer all points to the shellcode. Link to the genuine
    VTable is gone, and VPtr points a fake table. And when the code
    invokes one of the methods, the shell code executes.


  - Defences
      - Gnu C++ has compiler options to allow VPtr protection method to
        be added to the executable analogous to stack protection
        function that guards the return address. 
      - But this relies on VPtr being after the buffer in memory, but in
        C++ its before doesn’t mean its safe – next

**Defeating Visual C++**

![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 7 18 26 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75279485-9a97b080-5803-11ea-9176-521b6c0c636b.png)
  - This time you are relying on having 2 objects allocated on the heap.
    Instance of class A which defines a buffer which ur gonna overwrite,
    then there's a gap which ur gonna overrun everything, and after the
    gap there's an instance of B which has the VPtr.
  - If you overrun buffer in A, it can overrun all the instance
    variables, gap in heap and VPtr in B and make it point back to the
    injected VTable and Shellcode.
  - So you got compiler option to add VPtr protection option. So good
    idea to use them

**Integer overflow**

1.  300 \*300 = 24464 ???
2.  \-15000 – 25000 = 25536 ????
3.  32767+1 = -32768 ???

<!-- end list -->

  - The result is due to working in <span class="underline">16-bit
    signed integers</span>– it shows the fixed range of values. And if
    its over that value it wraps around to the lowest value of that
    range.
  - In C sharp, it does warn you – that arithmetic operation resulted in
    an overflow, but not in C++ and Java.

**Example**

~~~~
double* allocData(size_t n). {
  double* data = new double[n];
  if (data == NULL) {
    throw ApplicationException("out of memory");
   }
  return data;  
}
~~~~

  - In terms of security and the consequences
  - The functions job is to allocate storage – we are passing variable n
    of size t. size\_t is the same as unsigned int, where the range of
    value of n could be from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
  - Line highlighted – this does the arithmetic and hence problematic.
  - 2<sup>32</sup>-1 = 4294967295.
  - E.g – Double occupies 8 bytes. If n\*sizeof(double), how many bytes
    will be allocated when:
      - n = 536870911 ? A: 4294967288. When we multiply 8\*n, its still
        in the range of 2^32 -1
      - n= 536870913? A: 8. 8\*n exceeds the range of size t. So it
        wraps around and we get allocated 8 bytes. Problem is bc the
        size we need and what we got isn’t the same, overwriting can
        happen.

**Another example - concat data**

~~~~
size_t total = length1 + length2;
    where length1 = 320, length2 = 4,294,967,232 ⇒ total = 256
if (total > 256)
    return false;
int i = 0;
  for (; i < length1; ++i)
    tmp[i] = buf1[i];     tmp overrun by 64 bytes
  for (; i < total; ++i)
    tmp[i] = buf2[I – length1];
~~~~

  - A function takes 2 buffers and we concatenate and create a new
    buffer
  - First it calculates length 1 and 2 and if its bigger than 256 then
    it can't so it returns false. – it’s being careful with the if
    function (total \> 256) of buffer overrun but not Integer overflow.
  - BUT if fails to check if each length is less than 256. If length 1 =
    320, then problem\! That first if statement doesn’t solve the
    problem, so we are overrunning 320 when its 256.
      - The value wraps around and becomes 256 and it wraps around. And
        the bugger only has 256 where tmp got overrun by 64 bytes.
  - Watch out both buffer overrun and integer overflow\!\!


**Defensive strategies**
  - How can we avoid all of the low-level issues?
  - Memory protection technology such as NX bit \&ASLR
  - Change our development practices
      - A more secure language
      - Appropriate use of compiler options – warnings, add bound
        checking code and etc
      - Proper use of standard library – provide input with format sting
      - Special safe libraries – safestrcpy
      - Do integer arithmetic correctly – to prevent buffer and integer
        overflow

**Development practices**
  - Use libraries to do arithmetic safely
  - Consider using languages with array bounds checking – java, C\#,
    Python
  - Be careful with integer arithmetic
      - Use unsigned types where possible
      - Examine very carefully any code that calculates array indices or
        buffer lengths
      - Perform comparison properly – by checking explicitly for
        wrap-around
          - if (a+b \>=a && a+b \< MAX)– also checking that sum is
            greater than one of the values
          - e.g.2 – use \!jas\_safe\_size\_mul checks to see whether the
            multiplied value doesn’t exceed the required value


**Library usage**

  - When writing C++ use its standard library, not C’s\!
      - std:: string instead of char\*
  - Use C standard library <span class="underline">cautiously</span>
      - Never ever use gets to read a string
      - Avoid strcpy, strcat bound limited version is available but
        still can be abused
      - Take care with printf – never allow a user input to be a format
        specifier

**Summary**

  - Seen C’s printf functions plat far too much trust in format strings,
    allowing unrestricted manipulation of memory
  - Buffer overruns can affect the VTables of C++ classes
  - Problems with fixed-precision integer arithmetic can also trigger
    buffer overruns
  - There are various defences against low level issues – using hardware
    & OS features, compiler options, safer languages or libraries
