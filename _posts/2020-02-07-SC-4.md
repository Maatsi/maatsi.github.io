## **4. Message authentication**


**Objectives**

  - Review key points from last lecture on symmetric ciphers
  - Explore how cryptographic technology is used for
    <span class="underline">message authentication</span>

**Last time**

  - **Symmetric ciphers** perform encryption and decryption using a
    single **shared key**
  - We should use a recognized industry standard cipher: **AES** is a
    good choice
  - Security rests on **secrecy** of key (and its **resistance to brute
    forcing**)
      - Also its **randomness –** sooo important\!

**Brute-Forcing a Key**

  - If we create a machine who could do 10<sup>12</sup> decryption,
  - And DES is trivial to crack, smallest AES 128, is pass the age of
    the universe. you cannot brute force small AES in a realistic time

**Classic Cipher Modes**

  - **ECB** – encrypt given block of plain – never\!
  - **CBC** – avoid making it dependent on the previous step, and
    encrypting the XOR of a block of plaintext and the prev ciphertext.
  - **CTR** – keystream of bit by encrypting the combination of
    **nonce** and a **counter** then XORed with the plain text

**Putting things in perspective**

  - Provide I use a sensible cipher with a big enough key that is kept
    secret, and in the correct mode – no need to worry about crypto
    being a weak point.
  - Something else might be more on risk to keep ur system secure\!

**Message authentication**

  - To guarantee the <span class="underline">integrity</span> of the
    message (not edited) and <span class="underline">authenticity</span>
    (genuinely came from who sent it)
      - Sometimes we don’t want confidentiality\! so maybe not
        encryption. So we might need a slightly different technology
  - How do we know that the code hasn’t been tampered by an attacker?
      - No need to encrypt the code, but would be nice if there’s a way
        Message Authentication Code

**Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**

  - We tryna see if the message has been tampered and if it came from
    who claims to send it

1.  We got a chunk of msg m, and we feed the
    <span class="underline">shared key k<sub>ab</sub> and the msg</span>
    to the MAC algorithm (which encrypts it). Then we take the
    <span class="underline">last n bits</span> of the encryption and use
    it as a MAC.
2.  We stick the last n bit of MAC to the msg and transmit it
3.  Bob can take it, and split MAC from the msg, and bob needs to check
    it hasn’t been altered. How?
4.  He feeds the same shared key and the msg to the MAC algo which
    generates his own <span class="underline">computed MAC.</span>
5.  Then he compares the computed MAC and received MAC.

<!-- end list -->

  - Drawback
      - There still a possibility of replay, but could solve it by
        implementing a message counter so that duplicate msg could be
        detected

  - Q: What encryption mode is not appropriate?
      - ECB – each block is processed independently. MAC is of size n
        bits. Bcoz the encryption of the final block doesn’t depend on
        previous; we are free to change anything except for the bits in
        the final block. even when the message changed, won't know.

**Avoiding Encryption**

  - It’s a bit wasteful encrypting the cipher msg just to use the final
    bit of the MAC.
  - Encryption has a problem of it being slow
  - Also has political issues – restrictions of use of diff cipher coz
    of patents and export control
      - Banned export cryptographic technologies - relaxed now
  - We don’t need the transformation to be
    <span class="underline">reversible</span>\!\! If we are just tryna
    create MAC, we can use sth that’s faster and simpler **hash
    function**

**Hash** **Functions**

  - Transformation of the bits of the input msg produce the fixed length
    of output
  - Not a reversible, as you are throwing away information. Squeezing
    down the msg into small output is why its called **message digest**
    or **hash**
      - We can't recreate a msg from a **message digest**
  - Any tampering w the msg changes the value of the msg digest so is
    very sensitive to change
  - Computationally infeasible to:
      - Given a hash, it should be hard to find the original message x.
        one-way property
      - Very hard to find y that is not the same as x, that produces the
        same hash as x
          - Collision is when 2 inputs produce the same hash.
      - Finding any pair of messages that has the same hash.

**Using Hash Functions**

  - We go back to Alice and Bob with MAC. Now we gonna use **hash**
    instead of cipher.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Feed message to hash function and tap that h(MAC) on to the msg
2.  Is transmitted to bob
3.  Detaches the MAC, and feeds it to same hash function as Alice used,
    and now compare the computed hash and the received hash

<!-- end list -->

  - Q; what if somebody modifies hash and the function
      - They could. So it is not safe. Hence it isn’t a solution

**Possible Solution**

1.  Take the msg and hash it
2.  Feed a <span class="underline">key and hash</span> to a cipher and
    encrypt it now the <span class="underline">hash is encrypted,</span>
    and we stick it to a msg
3.  Transmit it
4.  Detach the Encrypted hash and decrypt it using the key, to output a
    hash.
5.  Feed the <span class="underline">same key</span> to the hash
    function to produce a computed hash and compare it with a received
    hash.

<!-- end list -->

  - Essentially, we brought encryption back. So what’s the advantage?
      - I'm only encrypting a small amt of data. My hash is only few
        numbers of bytes. less computation
      - Relatively expensive encryption of a small data, and cheaper
        hash functioning of a bigger message.

**Avoiding Encryption -** With the benefit of protecting us from
attacker modifying hash and the function.

1.  Alice’s <span class="underline">shared secret</span> is stuck to the
    msg, and we compute the hash of all of this.
2.  This is fed to the hash function and is stuck to the msg
3.  Transmit it
4.  Detach the hash, and he adds his <span class="underline">own shared
    secret</span>, and feed it to the same hash function and compares
    the two
<!-- end list -->
  - can't attack, provided that attacker doesn’t have a copy of a shared
    secret
  - Issue is the need for <span class="underline">shared secret</span> –
    somehow should be exchanged in a secret way.
  - Hash Based Message Authentication (**HMAC**)

**Standard Algorithms**

  - Some of the standard hashing algorithms
  - Output of hash is of fixed size.  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691747-f1860000-51db-11ea-9d8a-74c75c2be96e.png)

  - As it goes from md5 \~\~ others, there’s an Increase of output and
    block size more secure\!\!
  - Output size and level of security inversely proportional. So
    security is half the size of output size
  - RED – md5 and sha1 is not as secure as the theory would suggest.
  - We should be using the **SHA -2 family**
      - SHA 3 exists as a backup for SHA 2 failing at one point.

**Merkle-Damgård Construction**
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691834-5e00ff00-51dc-11ea-9b3c-e36dd0fa5380.png)
  - Take input msg (multiple of **512n**) so we have to **pad** it out.
    And store the **actual length** of the msg so that we can recover.
  - It is fed into the algorithm
  - Divide it into 512 bit chunks- B0, B1, … , Bn-1
  - For each, we feed to **compression function**, and we feed the
    output of processing the prev block together with the B0 B1 B2… So
    for the first block, we need an **IV**. Output of the function is a
    **160 bit** value.
      - Compression function is like a cipher, and it takes 2 (IV,
        B<sub>0</sub>) as its input.
  - Keep doing it until we done, and the final thing is our **HASH**
    this has been affected by every single bit

**Length extension Attacks \&HMAC**

  - Problem with this is that its prone to length extension attack
  - If they know the length of the msg, attackers can extend it with
    their msg with the same length, and hash that which would look like
    the original
      - E.g. 2009 Flickr API vulnerability
  - How do we stop it?
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74691755-f77be100-51db-11ea-9656-e35bef825d41.png)
      - **HMAC = Nested hashing -** We hash twice. We hash (the secret
        and the msg) and hash (THAT with another secret.
      - S<sub>IN</sub> , S<sub>OUT</sub> are derived from S by padding
        or hashing it to the size of a block and XORing with constants


**The main problem – Collisions\!**

  - Collision is inevitable. It is when 2 diff input generates the same
    hash.
  - It’s a problem bc the attacker could supply a diff msg and the hash
    value would be the same. And we won't be able to tell that the msg
    changed.
  - Our input could be anything any size. tremendous possible inputs we
    have, and are tryna squish that to a 20 bit output when the size of
    possible output is significantly less, collision is bide to happen.
  - Issue is COLLISION shouldn’t be easy to finndd\!\!\!\! so hash needs
    to get longer and longer

**Current State of Play**

  - MD5 was broke long ago, but can still be found.
      - E.g. we saw 2 files where 2 bites of the msg has changed, and
        when we do MD5, the hash is the SAME despite the fact that there
        was a difference\!\!\!\!\! Its too vulnerable
  - Its too easy for SHA 1 – so was deprecated by NIST.
  - Now major browsers don’t allow you to use SHA1.
  - Should use SHA 2 fam )))
      - Finding collision in a 256 is way harder

**SHA-1 Collision Research**

  - The SHAppening (2015): Its been discovered that we can find SHA1
    collision when you spend 100k.
  - Shatterd IO (2017): found a pracrical and realistic SHA1 collision
    for pdfs.
      - 2 pdf document – colour of the banner is different. And yet they
        have the same SHA 1 hash.

**Summary**

  - Discussed symmetric cipher modes in more detail
  - Explored how we can use message authentication codes (MACs) to
    ensure data integrity & authenticity
  - Seen that MACs can be derived from symmetric ciphers or **hash
    functions**
  - Noted that the MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms can be brute-forced;
    use SHA-2 or SHA-3 instead
