## Centralised vs decentralised systems

| **Centralised**                          | **Decentralised**                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One component with non- autonomous parts | Multiple autonomous components                                |
| Component shared by users all the time   | Components are not shared by all users                        |
| All resources accessible                 | Resources may not be accessible                               |
| Software runs in a single process        | Software runs in concurrent processes on different processors |
| Single point of control                  | Multiple points of control                                    |
| Single point of failure                  | Multiple points of failure                                    |

  - Multiple points of control – if you have a true dist sys – if one
    fails, rest will still work – you HIDE the aspect of failure\!

      - In google, it will fail all the time but for us it still works

## Types of distributed Systems

### 1 - High performance distributed computing systems
- Historically, if we look at parallel computing, aka running code over a large no of
processes. We have 2 models - Shared and distributed memory model. We
emphasized on two models

  - <span class="underline">Shared memory</span>– one memory, and large
    number of processors –to access the memory they have to go through
    interconnect (like a middleware). → it ensures the consistency of
    data.
      - OpenMP – famous – shared memory system
      - PThreads – another shared memory system
  - <span class="underline">Private memory</span> – everyone has their
    own memory
      - MPI – message passing interface
  - Bear in mind the two diff model. But there’s a third one –
    distributed shared memory\!

**Cluster computing**- to do with group of machines connected through LAN

  - Have all process, os, BUT there must be some form of node, a
    **master node**, it has application to run, has always compute
    nodes, and do some computation, and give me the result.

**Grid computing** (decentralize) – idea is that if you take number of
resources form various resources, why cant you bring them all together to
be shared by individuals → enabling communities which becomes a part of
virtual organization → idea of sharing resources, geographically\!

  - E.g. 1998 \[p8\] – grid comp was v important in the US. Teragrid –
    XSEDE now.
      - The resources are spread all over the country. What they do is
        they put all machines to a high-speed network→ resource
        sharing\!\! And you add the job to the queue, you don’t know where
        its gonna be executed. → it's a one single organization.
      - Interesting is that, you will benefit when managing and accessing
        the resources when you need them\!

  - Technical challenges of grid computing

      - **Security and trust** – no central control, so many admins -\>
        you gotta trust them all
      - **Resource stability** – resources come in and out and change
        over time.
      - **Complex distributed apps** – workflow (do I have an app that
        starts with 0 -00-00- back to 0) when im done with task 1, run
        23 paralley, can I have a resource scheduler??? whats
        interesting is if you have computing capability of a grid – you can
        do that fairly quickly\!
      - **Resource heterogeneity** – how heterogenous ur grid is – in
        terms of hardware, cpu, gpu – what kinda resource do you have on
        ur grid

Layered grid architecture – TCP/IP protocol stack

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74360603-48936b80-4dbd-11ea-949d-c1c41170f15d.png)
  - Fabric layer – compute resources, storage, network → control locally
  - Connectivity layer – talking to things, enabling ppl to have single
    sign on – imp aspect of sec.
  - Resource layer – is it possible now to share resources? What are the
    protocols that will allow me to configure my grid so that anyone
    could submit and run on these machines on the grid?
  - Collective layer – co-schedule and allocate resources

**Cloud computing** (centralized)
  - Computing resources by default are virtualized. And a lot of the
    services we access on phone will reside on a cloud.
  - Q: Example of virtualization
      - Hyper-V by Microsoft, amazon web services, doctor containers
  - 3 services of cloud computing
    1.  Infrastructure as service \<→ map with datacentre (hardware,
        cpu), computation, storage, like amazon s3
    2.  Platform layer \<--\> with storage framework, platform tools so
        that cloud provide you the platform you to just deploy it on that
        platform – MS azure
    3.  Software as a service – applications, web services

    <!-- end list -->


### 2 - Distributed information systems

  - Always need to integrate apps from here and there – apps that are
    usually networked, so the idea of interoperability was always
    problematic.
      - Apps are on server available to clients, and simple integration
        will consist all clients and requests from all apps, then send
        that off, finally present the copy of result to user
      - Can we have diff apps in diff servers to talk to each other?
        -enterprise application integration
<br/><br/>
  - E.g. Distributed Transaction Processing
      - Database applications where operations that are carried out as a
        transaction.
      - Transaction in database will have number of actions to execute
          - Begin, end, abort transaction
      - ALL OR NOTHING IS VERY VERY IMP\!\!
          - ACID – **atomic** (will happen indivisibly, happen or not
            happen), **consistent** (doesn’t lead to incorrect result),
            **isolated**, **durable** (when a commit is there, its
            permanent)
          - E.g. holiday - we gonna book a flight AND you needa book hotel
            too. They go together\!
              - If you decide to abort it, and ur not interested, you needa
                cancel both\! They have to abort. Because they need to
                abort, ACID holds.

<br/>

### 3 - Distributed Pervasive Systems
  - The node devices are small, mobile, and embedded in a larger system
    → naturally blends into the user’s environment → Its everywhere.
      - E.g. Internet of things – devices that are there to send some
        data.
      - E.g. Car that is always connected, smart city, fridge,
  - Three overlapping subtypes:
      - Ubiquitous- has to do with devices being all over the place, and
        as a user we can continuously communicate w/ the system.
      - Mobile- Devices are inherently mobile. It tends to move from one
        place to other. Then how do you trace them???

          - E.g. Mobile phone network where the millions of users move
            around, but are constantly connected.

      - Sensor networks – store, analyse, and make sense of data. Its
        important\! As you can potentially make decisions.

          - E.g. Smart city-Leeds. Number of sensors to detect
            pollution, air quality, etc

**E.g. IoT: Telemedicine Application -** Eg of an ubiquitous system


  - A person living on his own, bc of the issue, this person has some
    sensors on the body, like a <span class="underline">body
    sensor</span> node or a <span class="underline">wearable
    device</span>. What they do is they <span class="underline">send
    data</span>\! Ideally to the <span class="underline">doctor in the
    hospital.</span>
      - Consider: Is patient mobile data connected? Is wifi connected?
        Zigbee is used for communication btwn a sensor and a control
        system
  - Data is sent out, its saved in cloud, but the fact that the data is
    collected gives opportunities to doctors to analyse the data.
  - And there’s a software that analyses the data. Then you expect the
    doctor to be notified automatically through his phone to take further
    actions.

**E.g.2 – Connected Car**
  - A lot of cars are connected\! E.g. Jaguar. And its expected that
    100% of cars would be connected by 2025
  - When you drive this car, it will generate all sorts of data. As cars
    have <span class="underline">substantial amount of data</span>.
  - AND you HAVE TO analyse it very very quickly\!\!\!\! Inside a car,
    there’s a computing infrastructure that makes sure that car does
    analyse the data. But sometimes the car can't analyse everything due
    to the amount of data.
  - If the data is too big, send it to cloud and analyse it\! It has to
    be quick as it could be related to accidents

## Ubiquitous Computing Systems

  - If you look at any system, it’s likely that it will ALL support 5
    different characteristics
  - **Distribution** – Devices are networked, distributed, accessible in a
    transparent manner – all devices, computer, cloud, etc are
    distributed, and the fact that they are a part of d.s. it can be
    viewed as one single coherent system
  - **Interaction** – interaction btwn users and devices is highly
    unobtrusive (smooth and user is unaware)
      - If you take an example of a connected car, say this car is driven
        by wife or a husband. When its time for the husband to drive,
        the car is smart enough to sense that it’s the husband\!
        (position, weight). The car will make sure that this interaction
        will <span class="underline">lead to no. of events</span> –
        seating or mirror arrangements
          - Input device are used to identify situation → input analysis
            leads to actions
      - The interface is *seemingly* hidden in ubiquitous computing

  - **Context awareness** – system is aware of user context. Context BOARD
    written. To take context in which interactions take place into
    account. Raw data that’s collected by sensors is lifted and
    abstracted so that it can be used by applications
      - Where - location
      - Who – who is the user?
      - When – am I interacting now? Or later?
      - What – event or an action

  - **Autonomy** – system operates autonomously with minimum human
    interaction.
      - Take sensor network and you add one more device. Fact that you add a
        device and it interacts with the rest → system is autonomous\!\!
          - <span class="underline">Universal Plug and Play
            Protocol</span> (adding devices to an existing system)–
            devices can discover each other and make sure they can set
            up communications between them.
          - <span class="underline">Address allocation</span> - If the
            device is mobile, its likely that the IP address is gonna
            change. DHCP allocates IP address to any of these devices
            automatically.

  - **Intelligence** – can handle a wide range of dynamic actions and
    interactions using the methods and techniques from the field of AI.


## Mobile Computing Systems
  - Fact that we have mobile devices that changes location and that they
    can be added to a network. → Change of local services and
    reachability
  - They need to be reachable\!\! And communication can become hard in
    certain scenario. E.g. no signal. Therefore might not be reachable →
    connectivity is not always guaranteed

## Sensor Networks
  - Sensor network consists a <span class="underline">large number of
    small nodes</span>, equipped with sensing devices, they are usually
    <span class="underline">battery powered</span>, and uses wireless
    comm. It has <span class="underline">small computing power</span>
    and the <span class="underline">communicating capacity</span> is
    limited
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74360633-5812b480-4dbd-11ea-9102-b4b768527b5e.png)

  - **Model A** – the data collected in sensor network is sent directly
    to operator. The operator receives the data and potentially stores
    it and performs computation.
      - Easy architecture
      - Drawback - Since you are constantly using network resources to
        send the data, its a waste\! you may end up with so much data but
        not know what to do

  - **Model B**- The sensor is clever bc they can sense the data, store
    and process it locally\!\! When operator asks to ‘send me resources
    relating to x? ’ then the sensor network can send the result of the
    following query
      - Drawback – since the storage capacity in the sensor is usually
        limited → when operator sends a query, it may not rely on the
        aggregation of the data collected. Data might not be there\!
        overwritten

## Summary
  - We looked at diff types of distributed system
  - Emphasized the importance of
      - Computations
      - Information Processing
      - Pervasiveness
