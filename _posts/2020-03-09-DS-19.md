## **19. Trends**

**Goals** – Understand concepts surrounding ubiquitous clouds

**Clouds for the future internet and social networking**

  - 50 years ago, the internet was invented and 30 years – www, and the
    cluster, grid and cloud computing.
  - Cloud comp is seen as the base for anything you like to develop in
    the future
  - Internet of Things (IoT) - In addition to traditional access to
    machines, and the imp of objects and things being connected
      - Garage, car, house etc
      - If you are about to install a boiler, plumber will ask if I want
        access it on my phone
  - One thing likely is that this will generate massive amt of data to
    be stored, analysed and processed → Cloud is a foundation of these
    kind of applications
      - We need framework like Hadoop for data processing quickly
  - Cloud and IOT will reshape human factors and the way we live

**What IoT actually means**

  - Kevin Ashton said that the internet was created to connect
    computers, but we can connect more than that. We connect physical
    world so we have some form of ubiquitous computing and they’ll
    likely to have sensors and data
  - IDC report
      - Looks like IOT installed base will grow to 40 billion units
      - Amt of data it is gonna generate – 80—zettabytes

**IoT telemedicine applications**

  - Older person living own, and the person need constant monitoring on
    blood pressure, and a number of body sensors attached to herself and
    all these sensors generate data and sent to mobile phone to
    computing facility, and can use zigbee or wifi. Once it reaches, it
    will be stored and it can be analysed.
  - If comp facility is where the doctor is, the doctor can be notified
    when sth weird happens with the data that’s been analysed
  - Devices, sensors, data, wireless internet to support system

**How to integrate a fridge into IoT**

  - You could install sensors inside the fridge – it detects sth and tells
    you water filter needs replacing, etc
  - In order to implement this algo, you sense sth in the case of door
    being open, timer, etc and alarm goes off and person can go do sth
    about it
  - you can use barcode RFID and add more sensors into this fridge to
    detect sth else
      - Can have camera in the butter tray and test the weight of the
        butter and warn them if low
      - If you have set of recipes programmed, it can tell you what to
        make with the food it has
  - Some form of computational intelligence
  - More than that\!\! Computational intelligence + network connectivity
      - you can write code where a fridge can talk to you
      - And make the fridge order food– it needs list of things that its
        running low, and in order to do that it can look at a web
        service and they can order\! Ofc when you have registered credit
        card lmao
  - It requires
      - Local sensing
      - Local processing
      - Computational intelligence

**Architecture of the internet of things**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75291173-9ffff580-5819-11ea-857b-eaf2a9ef2760.png)
  - In order for IoT to work, we use bottom up approach
      - Sensing layer – about things and data – to collect data
      - Network layer - Data is sent to a cloud through mobile network,
        internet and information network
      - Application layer – that make use of sensing data and process
        this data once its available
          - Smart home, environment protection, telemedicine,
            Intelligent traffic – cities – with sensing and traffic
            lights and intelligent parking system
  - A layered architecture where application relies on a network and
    sensing data

**IOT: Smart everything**

  - Take data, cloud and application approach and do sth with it
      - Spain – a lot of IoT based application on ‘smart agriculture’
        to prevent for planned diseases
      - Monitoring radiation level generated by sun storms etc
      - Monitor radiation level in nuclear power plant - relies heavily
        on data
      - Pollution monitoring
          - More interesting bc they sense level of co2 and else related
            to pollution. And if it reaches certain threshold, there's a
            notification saying that you need to do sth
          - Quite imp example
      - Monitor water quality – same as smart agriculture
  - Looots of data to process and cloud is there as a support foundation

**Disruptive applications: New requirements**

  - These applications are know as disruptive. They are disruptive bc
    the underlying comp structure isn't designed to fulfil requirements
    of these applications
  - Sometimes, it will need to sense, store and process fairly quickly
    \!\! and have a time delay attached to the processing of the data
      - So low latency could be one of the demands to make the
        application successful
  - Send it to the cloud but it experiences data bottlenecks
      - Sensitive data and security concerns - you don’t want the data
        to be in the cloud
  - Increase network traffic and you increase the congestion in the
    network
  - Data analytics to have in place – will help you get new business
    model in order to make sense of the data

**Example: Driverless cars**

  - Number of sensors all around the car
  - Combination of enormous amount of sensor data and critical local
    processing power
  - Radar sensors to tell you what there is through a video camera,
    lidar sensors for light detection, GPS to know where it is, rear
    cameras, odometry sensors
      - Odometry – to do with how robot sense the data around it to
        estimate next position
  - A lot of real time applications and big data analysis
      - Decisions need to be made in milliseconds
  - Key REAL time requirement\!\! To ensure safety of ppl
  - Car is constantly connected to internet and the cloud – and rely
    heavily on cloud processing. Only problem with cloud is it could be
    late when receiving data from the cloud

**Fog / edge computing**

  - Data is processed in the closest computational resource, so the
    latency is low
  - Could have edge devices here and cloud data centres and in the
    middle have extra layer of fog layer –
      - Means that the driverless car to compute process and done
        quickly, you will rely on this middle layer close to the car
        that fulfils the requirement of the car
  - By pushing the intelligence and processing capabilities closer to
    where the application is\!\! → high bandwidth and low latency
  - Difference btwn the
      - Fog – could have many applications and they have to send data
        to cloud or LAN. The fog is a small cloud on LAN
      - Edge – simply send the data straight to an edge device – one
        device at a time.
      - They both support application, fog is LAN, number of
        elements, but edge is 1 device.

**Network-edge computing**
  - Car with embedded systems and sensors and data is generated.
  - Can send the data to cloud AND edge devices
  - you need to make calculation -Bandwidth from car to device
      - Bc - bandwidth to cloud
      - Be – bandwidth to edge
  - Driverless car would send data to cloud or edge depending on
    whatever\!
      - Edge is close to the car so low latency and high bandwidth but
        cloud with higher latency

**Conclusion**

  - Computing clouds and IoT affect the entire service industry and thus
    the future internet evolution
  - The cloud ecosystems demand ubiquity, efficiency and security
  - Clouds are crucial for the support of future applications and
    shape the future of Internet.
