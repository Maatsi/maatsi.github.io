## Domain Name System (DNS)
  - To access <http://aws.amazon.com> → amazon’s web service
<!-- end list -->
1.  First you ask how to get to aws.amazon.com – address
2.  IP will talk to a company or local DNS server – it redirects the
    request to root DNS server as IP address of amazon is not in the
    cache
3.  Root DNS must have the IP address of aws.amazon → so it returns the
    IP address to local DNS
4.  Local DNS server send the information to the client and cache to
    future use
5.  You get the website IP address of the website


**DNS partitioning**

  - DNS with global, administrative, and managerial level which is v
    imp\!\!\!

## DNS Zone Data
  - How its structured – it’s a tree and could look up for names through some form of attributes
  - Names and IP address of at least two name servers with authoritative
    data for the zone.
  - Names and IP addresses of name servers holding authoritative data
    for delegated sub-domains.
  - Importance of **caching and replication**
      - Data will keep changing – frequent on the leaf and less in root
      - Gotta ensure that when data is replicated, we have consistency
        when accessing the actual data
      - Even when you cache data the data, in the meantime could’ve
        changed → hence update needed
  - Each name server is free to cache from others, – but make sure that
    client is told such data are non-authoritative.
      - So when it comes to updating the data, make sure you are talking
        to the server
  - Concept of **TTL – time to live** – cached data can be used by client up
    to a time, but they need to call or ask server with authority to
    check the consistency of the data
      - E.g – what would be a TTL?
          - Since data change you need to ask authoritative to check and
            v frequently
          - Simply depends on which server and which zone we are on


**DNS: Information in a Node**

| **Type** | **Refers to** | **Description**                          |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SOA      | Zone          | Holds info on the represented zone       |
| A        | Host          | IP addr. of host this node represents    |
| MX       | Domain        | Mail server to handle mail for this node |
| SRV      | Domain        | Server handling a specific service       |
| NS       | Zone          | Name server for the represented zone     |
| CNAME    | Node          | Symbolic link                            |
| PTR      | Host          | Canonical name of a host                 |
| HINFO    | Host          | Info on this host                        |
| TXT      | Any kind      | Any info considered useful               |


## Attribute-base Naming: Directory Services

  - Is also known as directory services, where the entities have a set
    of associated attributes that can be used for searching.
  - DNS is a traditional Naming service
      - Given a name of the server, gives IP address back
      - Its conceptually equivalent to using a telephone directory. Give
        name, and it give you the num.
  - Directory service is a different approach
      - Implemented as a distributed database
      - A description is stored at a node and a partial description can
        be used to retrieve nodes
      - Lookup entities by means of their attributes.
      - Yellow pages – you look for a plumber service– it gives list of
        companies and numbers


## LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol*

  - Directory service and implemented on top of TCP and helps you access
    info all over the internet
  - Seen as a standard for internet-based directory services
  - In modern directory service, it has LDAP interface
      - Microsoft’s Active directory service is designed to centralise
        large company networks into one repository where admins can
        manage easily.
          - All the student record, staff records, labs, etc – is
            represented as a record.
      - When you store info and attributes you will always be able to
        search with entities you are looking for
  - \[13 pdf 9\] table - Each directory entry consists of standard
    (attribute, value) pairs, and is uniquely named for lookups
      - These are attribute names and have values associated with it
      - Country – UK, locality – Leeds, organisation – Leeds university
  - It has 2 very imp elements:
      - Directory Information Base – collection of all directory entries
        in an LDAP service
          - Each node is uniquely named as a sequence of naming
            attributes, Relative distinguished name, so that it can be
            looked up.
          - When you do lookup you always start with Relative
            distinguished name and say this is my first point of entry –
            I'm starting with country, locality, organisation, etc.
          - → RDN as a root of where you start looking
      - Directory Information Tree - the naming graph of an LDAP
        directory service, each node represents a directory entry
          - It leads to a hierarchy of the collection of directory
            entries
          - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 15 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288296-f5d19f00-5813-11ea-8556-5bb992c4012a.png)
      - When I wanna do a search, I start with Relative Distinguished
        Name.

**LDAP: Search Example**

  - Two directory entries having Hostname as RDN

| **Attribute**          | **Value**        | **Attribute**          | **Value**        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Locality**           | Leeds            | **Locality**           | Leeds            |
| **Organisation**       | Leeds University | **Organisation**       | Leeds University |
| **OrganisationalUnit** | Computing        | **OrganisationalUnit** | Computing        |
| **CommonName**         | Main server      | **CommonName**         | Main server      |
| **HostName**           | comp-pc3211      | **HostName**           | comp-pc3212      |
| **HostAddress**        | 192.31.231.11    | **HostAddress**        | 192.31.231.12    |
|                        |                  |                        |                  |

  - If I do a search on LDAP, id get this.
  - Result of search(‘‘(C=UK)(O=Leeds University)(OU=\*)(CN=Main
    server)’’) gives us a host name and address of Leeds uni
  - We are using a **standard** - the directory service should be
    designed in a way that search like below works.


## Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)

  - There is some code and you need access the directory service – how?
  - JNDI is an API for directory service that allows clients to discover
    and lookup data and objects via a name
  - Is independent of underlying implementation – it’s an interface
  - It specifies SPI – service provider interface – to plug the
    directory service into the framework
  - API will allow you to:
      - To find an object name and therefore bind to it
      - Lookup in the directory
      - Provides interface that allows clients to see which directory
        entries have been modified since the last time you made the
        request

**JNDI Architecture**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 16 05 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288333-097d0580-5814-11ea-94c2-9115f6346cbf.png)
  - JDNI is an interface that abstracts the platform or infrastructure,
    you expect to have API.
  - And the JNDI API talks to the naming manager → the heart of JDNI
  - Interface – I'm gonna talk to a service provider through one of the
    protocols
  - So it fits nicely with LDAP, DNS and old shit like RMI and COBRA
  - Just to plug it in\! I'm gonna talk to LDAP

**JNDI code example**

  - Functionality is mainly provided by javax.naming package, esp the
    Context and InitialContext class
  - Client creates a starting point for lookup, using InitialContext
  - Client calls lookup to find sub context or objects by names.
  - Server gets the appropriate context and call bind on it.
      - Once you have the account you can access the object the way you
        want
      - Account acct = new AccountImpl(“12345”);
      - ctx.bind(“John”, acct);

**Using LDAP via JNDI**

  - LDAP for JNDI comes as standard with java.
  - Instead of context you have InitialDirContext class and DirContext
    interface
  - When it comes to searching, you could search using specific
    attribute names
      - NamingEnumeration results = ctx.search("o=leeds.ac.uk", "(&(sn=Smith)(mail=\*))", ctl);

## Discovery in Web Services: UDDI

  - Another service – who help businesses find what web services are
    exposed, how can developers find WSDL they need etc → through UDDI\!
  - You could then invoke the service once you find it and see if you do
    can use it.

**The Big Picture**

  - ![Screenshot 2020-02-25 at 9 17 17 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/75288402-34fff000-5814-11ea-8b4c-386200fe77c0.png)
  - You have SOAP/REST client and you want to interact with it through a
    request reply, therefore you need an interface, which comes as WSDL
    or directly as a URL in REST.

**Fundamentals of UDDI**

  - Organisations wishing to expose their web services create a UDDI
    business registration in XML and publish it.
  - These registrations are held in a db, the UDDI business registry,
    replicated at UDDI operator sites.
  - It itself is a web service and could send query to the web and get
    back the interface via SOAP over HTTP
  - Relevant SOAP msgs can be constructed/ parsed by calls to a standard
    inquiry API and publishing API

**Example: a UDDI Query using JAXR: Java API for XML Registries**

1.  Create ConnectionFactory and set its properties, and create
    connection
2.  Obtain RegistryService object from connection, whuch exposes a
    BusinessQueryManager
3.  Call appropriate method of BusinessQueryManager to execute query,
    result being returned as a BulkResponse object
4.  Call methods of BulkResponse object to check for success or failure
    and extract details of organisations and services you need.

## Summary

  - Naming services allow us to bind a name to the attributes of some
    entity in a DS, and resolve a name into those attributes.
  - A directory service allows us to look up an entity by its attributes
    rather than its name.
  - LDAP: an important standard for directory services, commonly used
    these days
  - UDDI supports the publishing and discovery of Web services via a
    replicated database accessed as a Web service itself
  - JNDI provides a standard interface to naming services.
