## The Rest way of implementing the Web Service

  - Putting order on a part, and ur interested in list – then URL1 which
    is the list
  - U choose the part and access URL2 as a resource
  - If ur interested, you put a purchase order
  - Important here is you r in charge of sending HTTP get or post.
  - All three are resources

## The SOAP way of implementing the Web Service

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753390-fabcae80-5267-11ea-9ce6-a19d2a5c7434.png)
  - All the overhead here
  - Message, envelope, web server, opens it, invoke the method
  - Main diff is here the resources are used using SAME URL – so you
    need to specify the method you are gonna use
  - All three are methods

**HTTP Methods**

  - CRUD – create, read, update, delete
  - GET – defines a reading access of the resource without side-effects
  - PUT- creates a new resource
  - DELETE – removes the resources
  - POST - updates an existing resource of creates a new resource


## Data Encoding and RPC
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753412-027c5300-5268-11ea-8349-7504338b0a3b.png)
  - With **SOAP**, it is based on RPC – remote procedural call.
      - You make call to a remote object with necessary parameters, SOAP
        stack **serialises** parameters into XML and move the data using
        HTTP, receives response, deserializes it, and return
      - Data encoding expect to have both XML and JSON supported.
  - **REST** is very much on RPC side – you are accessing resource
    through HTTP protocol and that resource is identified as URI and you
    are still using a request reply protocol – to invoke a RESTful
    service.
  - They are still very close – RPC and REST
  - E.g.
      - Protobuf
          - Way of serialising structured data
          - Protobuf is in core of all internal RPC protocols in Google
      - Thrift
          - Software framework from Apache
          - Popular for services that needs cross-language service
            development - you develop sth in diff languages, and it
            supports a cross language services development
          - Comes with a code generation engine and allows ur software
            to write in various languages
      - Avro          - Data serialisation system
      - GSON
          - Google – Google, de/serialisation library just like JSON
          - Converts Java objects into JSON and back.



**Java and REST**

  - Once I know how to write a program – we can say REST is server and
    client
  - There's java specification request 311 called JAX-RS
  - Itself uses annotations to define the REST relevance of Java classes
  - Idea is to use Class with REST style
  - Together with. Java Architecture for XML Binding – JAXB
  - We can take the specification and implement it
      - Make sure it's interoperable.
      - One of them is Jersey

**Jersey**

  - Reference implementation for JAX-RS
  - Contains a RESR server and a RESR client
  - Server side – uses servlet which scans predefined classes to
    identify RESTful resources
  - More importantly how jersey expects you to use concept of resources
  - http://your\_domain:port/display-name/url-pattern/path\_from\_rest\_class
      - ur domain
      - local host
      - display name
      - url pattern
      - path from the class
  - there are other things as well – RESTEasy, Struts, etc


**JAX-RS Annotations**
  - how do I know how to annotate the code?
  - HTTP relies on Post, get, put, delete – I need understanding and how
    I'm gonna annotate them
  - 7 annotations are enough to deploy a web service
  - @PATH(your path) - Before all this I need to set my base url
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753446-0ad48e00-5268-11ea-974d-5c8d9469b391.png)
  - @Produces(MediaType) – I define what media type is delivered by a
    method @GET. i.e. xml? Html? json? Plaintext?
  - @Consumes – it defines media type that is consumed by the method –
    which is usually a post.

## Steps

1.  Create the Restful Web Service
    1.  Looks like I'm gonna set the path to the base URL
    2.  Once I do that I create a class CalcREST and think of parameters
    3.  Add and expect 2 parameters
    4.  Id like to produce a media type – as a plain text
    5.  A method that is attached to addd get – this would expect 2
        parameters
    6.  And the method returns a+b
    7.  Second get – same thing to be done but the media type is XML\!\!


2.  Publish the Restful Web Service
    1.  We need to know where to access it – what's the URL – the fact
        that I attached URL is imp
    2.  I'm gonna start the server


3.  Create a Restful Web Service Client
    1.  Client can do add and sub
    2.  Gonna create a class and create client through that
    3.  Gonna create addService – which adds 2 and get the response
    4.  Through XML or Text


  **Testing the Service**
   - How do I write my client to use this service
   - With jersey, you can see whether ur service is up and running
    through http://localhost:9999/calcrest/application.wadl
