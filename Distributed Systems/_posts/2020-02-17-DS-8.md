## What is REST?
  - REST is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems
  - REpresentational State Transfer
  - What's interesting is that this style came out in phd thesis – in
    2000. And this changed the world – 3%
  - Reason is that this rest as framework states that the existing
    principles and protocols are enough – you don’t need SOAP, deploying
    and all. Why can't we use WS in a more simplistic way?


**What does it consist of?**
  - **Resources** – application state and functionality is divided into
    resources and anything that I access through REST is a resource
  - **Universal syntax** – every resource is uniquely accessible through
    universal syntax and for use in hypermedia links
  - **Uniform interface** – all resources share the same interface, so with
    one interface you can access all resources behind the actual service
    and for the transfer of state btwn a client and a resource.
  - You always need an **interface**, and this will feature **constrained set of well-defined operations** and a **constrained set of content types**
  - Protocol that is
      - client/server – send request, then reply back
      - stateless – server is stateless – server forgets who is invoking
        what – doesn’t keep track of client interaction
      - cacheable – invoke a service and the resource is cached
      - layered – in terms of functionalities on client and server side.
  - end of the day, we have access to number of resources that is
    clearly constrained


**Why is it called “Representation State Transfer”?**

  - However, more interesting – what is state and transfer?
  - E.g. where you have a client and you access a resource through URI,
    where it's to do with the aircraft. Then client needs to get info
    coz they gotta do maintenance work of the aircraft.
      - Web resource is a URL – server returns a representation of the
        resource. Here’s a rep of what your asking for – i.e. html doc
      - The representation will put the client into diff state as they
        are having access to 787.html
      - It will traverse the link and will find other resource – then ur
        exposed to new representation hence a change of state
  - State keeps changing, and it transfers from one to another


## The REST way of implementing the Web Services
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74753188-a9142400-5267-11ea-998b-dbde0f772fe8.png)  
1.  Get part list – use URL 1, look at the server, change the state, and
    client gets HTTP response through that invocation
2.  Get detailed information about a particular part – client gets a
    document of list as an html, and looks through the doc. Therefore,
    it invokes another service part 2, through second URL and get http
    response
3.  Submit a purchase order (PO) – if the client is happy with the part
    info, then they will send the HTTP POST to response purchase order
<!-- end list -->
  - Keep this slide in mind, we’ll get back.
<!-- end list -->


1.  Get a list of parts → First invocation
<!-- end list -->
  - The restful service will send back a part list. URI through
    <http://www.parts-depot.com/parts>
  - If we want to specify the type of document, we need to specify our
    flavour – to xml or json
  - **Data Returned – Parts List III**
      - Parts list has links to get detailed information about each
        part. → key feature of REST
      - By client invoking one of the lists, client transfers from one
        state to the next by examining and choosing from among the
        alternative URLs
<!-- end list -->
2.  Get information about a particular part
<!-- end list -->
  - RESTful WS makes available a URI to each part resource
      - BUT it's not a true physical URI \!\!its coz if we had one
        million, we don’t wanna associate each one with one million.
  - What we are expressing here is what resource is desired - it is a
    logical URI
  - **Data Returned**
      - In the HTML doc that got sent back to a client, there's another
        link, saying that here’s a specification if you need it → Again
        we don’t need one million, it's logical URI
      - Data is linked to still more data – specification for this part
        is found by traversing the hyperlink → you access the resource
        and change the state.
<!-- end list -->
3.  Service: Submit a Purchase Order (PO)
<!-- end list -->
  - As opposed to first and second, this will be done in
    <span class="underline">HTTP post</span> – you make sure that you
    conform to a XML schema definition. RESTful server will ensure that
    my purchase conforms to this
  - Once client submits PO through HTTP post – server will take that
    into consideration


## Claimed Benefits
  - **Provides improved response times** – caching comes as a plus
  - **Improves server scalability** – bc servers are stateless, it doesn’t
    need to handle subsequent request or no need to remember what
    happened before
  - **Depends less on vendor software** – don’t need any software in terms
    of web and messaging framework – http should be enough →
    <span class="underline">main benefit\!</span>
  - **Provides equivalent functionality** - compared to SOAP, can have same
    functionality
  - **Does not require a separate resource discovery mechanism** – since
    everything is http and hyperlink. As long as you know what the API
    is needed to access the resource, should be enough
  - **Provides better long-term compatibility and evolvability** – better
    than RPC (used for SOAP) – if you have more parts, and you change
    info regarding one part, the compatibility is maintained. Bc content
    types are defined without dropping or reducing the support of other
    content types.


**Implementing the Web Services using SOAP**
  - Difference btwn service using SOAP and REST- compare \[9 pdf 10\]
    and \[9 pdf 19\]
  - URLs
      - SOAP – we use one URL to access the service. URL1 to get list,
        get part and to submit. So soap we need to specify what the name
        of the method we are invoking – getPartList()
      - REST it uses all diff URLs for each – URL1,2, and 3.
  - HTTP invocation
      - REST - to get the part list, we used HTTP GET and to order, we
        used HTTP POST
      - SOAP – its all through HTTP POST.
  - Major diff is to do with karim is **overhead**
      - Q: Can we quantify how many operations we need to make this
        happen?
          - SOAP - To have part list, client needs to make a request
            (SOAP msg), then it goes into an envelope → so the soap
            message here is petty huge in terms of size. Send it through
            URL, and when soap server gets it, it needs to realize the
            envelop, open it and interpret the msg and invoke the method
          - The overhead here is huge\!\!

How to bring some semantic on any resource that we access on web
  - Is through a framework RDF – Resource Description Framework
  - There's a language associated with semantic web called OWL
  - <span class="underline">Ontologies</span> – if we create ontology,
    we have reason about the data once it is represented through this
    framwwork


**Conclusions**

  - There is a big debate in the WS community about whether to use
    REST/SOAP
  - Lot of Web services is 80% REST, and 20% SOAP → still need legacy
    support of soap
  - Many companies are offering their Web services using REST, example:
      - Twitter, Search API, Maps, live, photos, traffic etc
