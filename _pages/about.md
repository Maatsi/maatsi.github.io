## Chae Rim Kim
I am an innovative and technically driven third-year Computer Science student, with strong academics and interest in innovative and scalable technologies.

Always loving to dive into new things, I never settle for mediocre. I find it fascinating that there are new ideas to discover and learn every day in this constantly evolving era. By learning and adapting to new topics and environments fast, I aim to draw my maximum ability within the given time.

My final year project explores the new computing paradigm, edge computing. It brings the computing resources and intelligence closer to the data source, resulting in more efficient processing with high bandwidth and low latency. The architecture is utilised in IoT applications that require real-time data, such as Autonomous Vehicles and face recognition applications. Through EdgeCloudSim, various experiments regarding the effect of computational and networking system parameters on the application performance is carried out.

The topic still being in its infancy, the project has led me to explore and tackle unconventional and untouched problems - teaching me to value the challenges and to think outside of the box.

Through strong programming skills in Python and Java, I experiment and come up with new solutions to a complex problem by analysing the problem scope thoroughly. Together with my work ethic and time management, I believe I can apply the knowledge I have accumulated throughout to a new context, to contribute to building ground-breaking technical services.


## Growing up

Growing up, I had a lot of opportunities to cross different cultures - from travelling to studying abroad in New Zealand, Germany and now in United Kingdom. I grew up in Korea until my early teenage years, then I moved to Germany and attended an International School in Hannover, since 2012.

I have learned to become an open minded and communicating thinker - being surrounded by various cultures has led me to appreciate individuals, and learned to confidently and creatively express myself. Always showing compassion and respect towards people, I aim to make a positive difference in our lives.



## In this blog

I wish to share my notes and resources that I have created for various modules, in a structured and readable way. At the moment it includes:
 - Distributed Systems
 - Machine Learning
 - Secure Computing

Code implementation of specified topics (Github) will be linked in the post if relevant.
