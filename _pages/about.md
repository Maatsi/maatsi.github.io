## Chae Rim Kim
I am an innovative and technically driven third-year Computer Science student, with strong academics and interest in innovative technologies and distributed computing.

My final year project, edge computing still being in its infancy, has led me to explore and tackle unconventional and untouched problems; teaching me to value the challenges and to think outside of the box.

I aim to deliver novel and logical solutions to a complex problem in a timely manner, by analysing the problem scope thoroughly and experimenting with creative solutions with my strong programming skills in Java and C++.

My ambition is to contribute to building scalable and ground-breaking technical services that will positively impact our daily lives.

## Growing up

Growing up, I had a lot of opportunities to cross different cultures - from travelling to studying abroad in New Zealand, Germany and now in United Kingdom.

I grew up in Korea until my early teenage years, then I moved to Germany to attend an International School in Hannover since 2012.

 I have learned to become an open minded and communicating thinker - being surrounded by various cultures has led me to appreciate individuals, and learned to confidently and creatively express myself. Always showing compassion and respect towards people, I aim to make a positive difference in our lives.
