## Chae Rim Kim
I am an innovative and technically driven Computer Science graduate, with strong academics and interest in unconventional and scalable technologies. Always loving to dive into new things, I find it fascinating that there are new ideas to discover and learn every day in this constantly evolving era.

My final year project explores the new computing paradigm, edge computing, utilised in IoT applications that require real-time data, such as Autonomous Vehicles and face recognition applications. It brings the computing resources and intelligence closer to the data source, resulting in more efficient processing with high bandwidth and low latency. The research illustrated that this can be achieve by implementing 1. numerous edge servers and 2. faster VM processing speed - it utilised the EdgeCloudSim simulator.

With strong programming skills in Python and Java, I experiment and come up with new solutions to a complex problem through iterative implementation and a thorough analysis of the problem scope. Together with my work ethics and time management, I believe I can expand my horizon and contribute to the IT industry.


## Growing up
Growing up, I had a lot of opportunities to cross different cultures - from travelling to studying abroad in New Zealand, Germany and now in the United Kingdom. I grew up in Korea until my early teenage years, then moved to Germany in 2012 and attended an International School in Hannover.

I have learned to become an open minded and communicating thinker - being surrounded by various cultures has led me to appreciate individuals, and learned to confidently and creatively express myself. Always showing compassion and respect towards people, I aim to make a positive difference in our lives.



## In this blog

I will share:
1. My notes and resources that I have created for various modules, in a structured and readable manner. At the moment it includes:
  - Distributed Systems
  - Machine Learning
  - Secure Computing
  - Recommender Systems

2. Daily technology news update
  - Includes the 6 Ws summary of the day's news update regarding IT.

3. Coding Interview preparation
  - Will be uploading a code implementation of a Hackerrank coding preparation.
  - Rundown on coding interview questions and implementations for it.


If relevant, code implementation of specified topics (Github) will be linked in the post.
